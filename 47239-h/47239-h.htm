<h2><a name="page1"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 1</span>I</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> last we are safely arrived at
York, perhaps no cause for comment in these days, but a
circumstance which &ldquo;once upon a time&rdquo; might almost
have warranted a special service of prayer and praise in the
Minster.&nbsp; One comes to York as the capital of a country,
rather than of a county, for it is a city that seems in more than
one sense Metropolitan.&nbsp; Indeed, you cannot travel close
upon two hundred miles, even in England and in these days of
swift communication, without feeling the need of some dominating
city, to act partly as a seat of civil and ecclesiastical
government, and partly as a distributing centre; and if something
of this need is even yet apparent, how much more keenly it must
have been felt in those &ldquo;good old days&rdquo; which were
really so bad!&nbsp; A half-way house, so to speak, between those
other capitals of London and Edinburgh, York had all the
appearance of a capital in days of old, and has lost but little
of it, in these, <a name="page2"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
2</span>even though in point of wealth and population it lags
behind those rich and dirty neighbours, Leeds and Bradford.&nbsp;
For one thing, it has a history to which they cannot lay claim,
and keeps a firm hold upon titles and dignities conferred ages
ago.&nbsp; We may ransack the pages of historians in vain in
attempting to find the beginnings of York.&nbsp; Before history
began it existed, and just because it seems a shocking thing to
the well-ordered historical mind that the first founding of a
city should go back beyond history or tradition, Geoffrey of
Monmouth and other equally unveracious chroniclers have
obligingly given precise&mdash;and quite
untrustworthy&mdash;accounts of how it arose, at the bidding of
kings who never had an existence outside their fertile
brains.</p>
<p>When the Romans came, under Agricola, in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 70, York was here.&nbsp; We do not
know by what name the Brigantes, the warlike tribe who inhabited
the northern districts of Britain, called it, but they possessed
forts at this strategic point, the confluence of the rivers Ouse
and Foss, where York still stands, and evidently had the military
virtues fully developed, because it has seemed good to all who
have come after them, from the Romans and the Normans to
ourselves, to build and retain castles on the same sites.&nbsp;
The Brigantes were a great people, despite the fact that they had
no literature, no science, and no clothes with which to cover
their nakedness, and were they in existence now, might be useful
in teaching our War Office and commanding officers something of
strategy and fortification.&nbsp; They have left memorials of
their existence in the names of many places beginning with
&ldquo;Brig,&rdquo; and they are the sponsors of all the brigands
that ever existed, for their name was a Brito-Welsh word meaning
&ldquo;hill-men&rdquo; or &ldquo;highlanders,&rdquo; and, as in
the old days, to be a highlander was to be a thief and
cut-throat, the chain of derivative facts that connects them with
the bandits of two thousand years is complete.</p>
<p><a name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>A hundred
and twenty years or so after the Romans had captured the
Brigantes&rsquo; settlement here, we find York suddenly emerging,
a fully-fledged Roman city, from the prehistoric void, under the
name of Eboracum.&nbsp; This was in the time of the Emperor
Septimus Severus, who died in <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span>
211 in this <i>Altera Roma</i>, the principal city of Roman
Britain.&nbsp; For this much is certain, that, as Winchester was,
and London is, the capital of England, so was York at one time
the chief city of the Roman colony, the foremost place of arms,
of rule, and of residence; and so it remained until Honorius, the
hard-pressed, freed Britain from its allegiance in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 410 and withdrew the
legionaries.&nbsp; Two hundred years is a considerable length of
time, even in the history of a nation, and much happened in
Eboracum in that while.&nbsp; Another Roman emperor died here, in
the person of Constantius Chlorus, and his son, Constantine the
Great, whom some will have it was even born here, succeeded
him.&nbsp; Both warred with the Pictish tribes from the North;
that inhospitable North which swallowed up whole detachments; the
North which Hadrian had conquered over two hundred years before,
and now was exhausting the energies of the conquerors.&nbsp;
Empire is costly in lives and treasure, and the tragedy of Roman
conquest and occupation is even now made manifest in the
memorials unearthed by antiquaries, recording the deaths of many
of the Roman centurions at early ages.&nbsp; Natives of sunny
Italy or of the south of France, they perished in the bleak hills
and by the wintry rivers of Northumbria, much more frequently
than they did at the hands of the hostile natives, who soon
overwhelmed the magnificence of Eboracum when the garrisons
left.&nbsp; The civilisation that had been established here,
certainly since the time of Severus, was instantly destroyed, and
Caer Evraue, as it came to be called, became a heap of
ruins.&nbsp; Then came the Saxons, who remodelled the name into
Eoferwic, succeeded in turn by the Danes, from whose
&ldquo;Jorvic,&rdquo; pronounced <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>with the soft J, we obtain Yorvic, the
&ldquo;Euerwic&rdquo; of Domesday Book, and finally York.&nbsp;
But whence the original &ldquo;Eboracum&rdquo; derived or what it
meant is purely conjectural.</p>
<p>Christianity, fulfilling Divine promise, had brought
&ldquo;not peace, but a sword&rdquo; to the Romans, and the Saxon
king, Edwin of Northumbria, had not long been converted and
baptized at York, on the site of the present Minster, before he
was slain in conflict with the heathen.&nbsp; It was Paulinus,
first Archbishop of York, who had baptized Edwin in 625.&nbsp;
Sent to the North of England by Gregory the Great, as Augustine
had already been sent for the conversion of the South, it was the
Pope&rsquo;s intention to establish two Archbishoprics; and
thence arose centuries of quarrelling between the Archbishops of
Canterbury and those of York as to who was supreme.&nbsp; York,
indeed, only claimed equal rights; but Canterbury claimed
precedence.&nbsp; In the Synod of 1072 the Archbishop of York was
declared subordinate to Canterbury, but half a century later, in
order to make peace, Rome adjudged them equal.&nbsp; Even this
did not still the strife, and Roger Pont
l&rsquo;&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, the Archbishop of York, who was
contemporary with Becket, and aided the king in his struggle with
that prelate, was especially bitter in the attempt to assert in
all places and at all seasons this equality.&nbsp; He renewed the
contention with Becket&rsquo;s successor, and provoked an absurd
scene at the Council of Westminster in 1176, when, arriving late
and finding the Archbishop of Canterbury present and already
seated, he sat down in his lap.&nbsp; The result was, that the
Council of Westminster immediately resolved itself into a faction
fight, in which my lord of York was jumped upon and kicked, for
all the world like a football umpire who has given an unpopular
decision.&nbsp; Even this did not settle either the Archbishop of
York or the strife, and so at last, in 1354, it was decreed that
each should be supreme in his own Province, and that the
Archbishop of Canterbury should be &ldquo;Primate of All
England,&rdquo; <a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
5</span>while his brother of York should bear the title of
&ldquo;Primate of England&rdquo;; but whenever an Archbishop of
York was consecrated he should send to the Primate of All England
a golden jewel, valued at &pound;40, to be laid on the Shrine of
St. Thomas.&nbsp; &ldquo;Thus,&rdquo; says Fuller, in his
inimitably humorous manner, &ldquo;when two children cry for the
same apple, the indulgent father divides it between them, yet so
that he gives the better part to the child which is his
darling.&rdquo;&nbsp; Rome has long since ceased to have part or
lot in the English Church, but this solemn farce of nomenclature
is still retained.</p>
<p>In such things as these does York retain something of its old
pride of place.&nbsp; Even its Mayor is a Lord Mayor, which was
something to be proud of before these latter days, now Lord
Mayors are three a penny, and every bumptious modern overgrown
town is in process of obtaining one.&nbsp; The first Lord Mayor
of York, however, was appointed by Richard the Second, and thus
the title has an honourable antiquity.</p>
<p>In its outward aspect, York is varied.&nbsp; It runs the whole
gamut, from the highest antiquity to the most modern of shops and
villas; from the neatest and tidiest streets to the most
draggle-tailed and out-at-elbowed courts and alleys.&nbsp; From
Clifton and Knavesmire, which is a great deal more respectable
and clean than its evil-sounding name would lead the stranger to
suppose, to the Shambles, Fossgate, and Mucky Peg&rsquo;s Lane
(now purged of offence as Finkle Street) is a further social than
geographical cry, and they certainly touch both extremes.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mucky Peg&rdquo; and the knaves of the waste lands outside
the city are as historic in their way as Roman York, which lies
nine feet below the present level of the streets, and for whose
scanty relics one must visit the Museum of the Philosophical
Society in the grounds of the ruined St. Mary&rsquo;s
Abbey.&nbsp; In those grounds also the only fragment of the Roman
walls may be seen, in the lower stage of the Multangular Tower,
once commanding the bank of the river Ouse.</p>
<p>York is perhaps of all English towns and cities the <a
name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 6</span>most difficult
place to explore.&nbsp; Its streets branch and wind in every
direction, without any apparent plan or purpose, and thus an
exploration of the Walls, of which the city is, with reason,
extremely proud, becomes the best means of ascertaining its
importance and the relative positions of Castle and
Minster.&nbsp; It is no short stroll, for, by the time the whole
circuit is made, a distance of nearly three miles has been
covered.&nbsp; These medieval walls form, indeed, the most
delightful promenade imaginable, being built on a grassy rampart
and provided with a paved footpath running on the inner side of
the battlements, and thus commanding panoramic views within and
without the city.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Endeavour, by an effort of the imagination, to see the ground
outside the walls free from the suburbs that now spread far in
almost every direction, and you have the York of ancient days,
little changed; for from <a name="page7"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 7</span>this point of view, looking down upon
the clustered red roofs of the city, with its gardens and
orchards, the towering bulk of the Minster, and the broad expanse
of adjoining lawns, nearly all the signs of modern life are
hidden.&nbsp; Something of an effort it is to imagine the great
railway station of York away, for it bulks very largely outside
the walls near the Lendal Bridge; but the medi&aelig;val gates of
the city help the illusion, and hint at the importance of the
place in those times.&nbsp; Micklegate Bar, the chief of them,
still bears the heraldic shields sculptured hundreds of years
ago, when kings of England claimed also to be kings of France and
quartered the <i>sem&eacute;e</i> of lilies with the lions.&nbsp;
There are four arches now to this and three to the other bars,
instead of but the one through which both pedestrian and other
traffic went in olden times; but the side arches have been so
skilfully constructed in the medi&aelig;val style that they are
not an offence, and are often, indeed, taken on trust as old by
those unlearned in these things.&nbsp; Stone effigies of
men-at-arms still appear on the battlemented turrets, and take on
threatening aspects as seen against the skyline by approaching
travellers.&nbsp; But did they ever achieve their purpose and
succeed in deceiving an enemy into the belief that they were
really flesh and blood?&nbsp; If so, they must in those days have
been very credulous folk, to be imposed upon by such devices.</p>
<p>Crossing the Ouse by Lendal Bridge, where chains stretched
across the river from towers on either bank formerly completed
the circle of defences, Bootham Bar is reached, spanning the exit
from York along the Great North Road.&nbsp; Still a worthy
approach to, or exit from, the city, it wore a yet more imposing
appearance until towards the close of the coaching age, when its
barbican, the outworks with which every one of the York bars was
provided, was wantonly destroyed.&nbsp; Those who would recall
the ancient appearance of Bootham Bar and its fellows, as viewed
from without, have only to see Walmgate Bar, whose barbican still
<a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>remains, the
only one left in the march of intellect and of
&ldquo;improvements.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then it presented a forbidding
front to the North, and with the walls, which were here at their
highest and strongest, disputed the path of the Scots.&nbsp; The
walls have been broken down and demolished between the river and
this bar, and modern streets driven through, so that something of
the grim problem presented to a northern enemy is lost to the
modern beholder; but the view remains among the finest, and
comprises the towers of the Minster, peering in grandeur from
behind this warlike frontal.&nbsp; The Scots were here soon after
Bannockburn.&nbsp; In 1319 an army of 15,000 came down, and York
would probably have fallen had it not been for these strong
defences, the finest examples of military architecture in
England.&nbsp; As it was, they found York too well cared for, and
so, destroying everything outside the walls and leaving it on
their left, they endeavoured to pass south by Ferrybridge.&nbsp;
At Myton-upon-Swale, near Boroughbridge, they met the English,
hastily brought up by the Archbishop, and defeated them with the
utmost ease.&nbsp; But prudence was ever a Scottish
characteristic, and so, with much booty, they retreated into
Scotland, instead of following up their advantage.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The walk along the walls from Bootham Bar to Monk Bar is
glorious in spring, with the pink and white blossoms of apple,
pear, and plum-trees, for here the well-ordered gardens of the
ecclesiastical dignitaries are chiefly situated.&nbsp; Midway,
the wall makes a return in a south-easterly direction.&nbsp; Monk
Bar, whose name derives from General Monk, Duke of Albemarle, was
once known as Goodramgate, and the street in which it stands
still bears that name, supposed to be a corruption of
&ldquo;Guthram,&rdquo; the name of some forgotten Danish
chieftain.&nbsp; At some distance beyond it, the wall goes off
due east, to touch the river Foss at Layerthorpe, where that
stream and the quagmires that once bordered it afforded an
excellent defence in themselves, without any artificial
works.&nbsp; Thus it is that the wall ceases entirely until the
Red Tower is reached, on the <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>outer bank of the Foss, where it
recommences and takes a bend to the south-west.&nbsp; From this
point to Walmgate Bar and the Fishergate Postern it is
particularly slight, the necessary strength being provided by the
Foss itself, forming a second line of defence, with the castle
behind it.&nbsp; Thence we come to the broad Ouse again, now
crossed by the Skeldergate Bridge, but once protected, as at
Lendal, by chains drawn from bank to bank.&nbsp; On the opposite
bank, on the partly natural elevation of Baile Hill, stood a
subsidiary castle, and here the wall is carried on a very high
mound until it rejoins Micklegate Bar.</p>
<p>There are but few so-called &ldquo;streets&rdquo; in
York.&nbsp; They are mostly &ldquo;gates,&rdquo; a peculiarity of
description which is noticeable throughout the Midlands and the
North.&nbsp; And queerly named some of these &ldquo;gates&rdquo;
are.&nbsp; There is Jubbergate, whose name perpetuates the memory
of an ancient Jewish quarter established here; Stonegate, the
narrow lane leading to the Minster, along which went the stone
with which to build it; Swinegate, a neighbourhood where the
unclean beasts were kept, and many more.&nbsp; But most curious
of all is &ldquo;Whipmawhopmagate,&rdquo; a continuation of
Colliergate.&nbsp; This oddly named place is rarely brought to
the notice of the stranger, because it has but two houses; but,
despite its whimsical name, it has a real, and indeed a very old,
existence.&nbsp; Connected with its name is the institution of
&ldquo;Whip Dog Day,&rdquo; a celebration once honoured on every
St. Luke&rsquo;s Day, October 18, by the thrashing of all the
dogs met with in the city.&nbsp; According to the legend still
current, it seems that in medi&aelig;val times, while the priest
was celebrating the sacrament at the neighbouring church of St.
Crux, he dropped the consecrated pax, which was swallowed by a
stray dog who had found his way into the building.&nbsp; For this
crime the animal was sentenced to be severely whipped, and an
annual day was set apart for the indiscriminate thrashing of his
fellows.&nbsp; A more likely derivation of the name of
Whipmawhopmagate is from the spot having been the <a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>whipping-place of religious penitents, or of merely
secular misdemeanants.</p>
<h2>II</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> grim blackened walls of York
Castle confront the traveller who approaches the city by
Fishergate, and lend a gloomy air to the entrance; the more
gloomy because those heavy piles of sooty masonry nowadays
encircle a prison for malefactors, rather than forming the
defences of a garrison, and keep our social enemies within,
instead of a more chivalric foe without.&nbsp; For over two
hundred years York Castle has been an assize court and a gaol,
and the military element no longer lends it pure romance.&nbsp;
Romance of the sordid kind it has, this beetle-browed place of
vain regrets and expiated crimes, of dismal cells and clanking
fetters; but if you would win back to the days of military glory
which once distinguished it, your imaginary journey will be
lengthy indeed.&nbsp; These battlemented walls, enclosing four
acres of ground, and with a compass of over eleven hundred yards,
were completed in 1856, and, with the prison arrangements within,
cost &pound;200,000.&nbsp; If, as the poet remarks, &ldquo;peace
hath her victories, no less renowned than war,&rdquo; she also
needs defences, as much against the villainous centre-bit as
against the foreign foe.</p>
<p>But there is still something left of the York Castle of old,
although you must win to it past frowning portals eloquent of a
thousand crimes, great and small, guarded by prison warders and
decorated with notice-boards of Prison Regulations.&nbsp;
Clifford&rsquo;s Tower, this ancient portion, itself goes no
farther back into history than the time of Edward the First; and
of the buildings that witnessed the appalling massacre of the
Jews, in March 1190, nothing fortunately remains.&nbsp; It cannot
be to the advantage of sightseers that the blood-stained stones
of that awful time should stand.&nbsp; History alone, without the
aid of sword or shattered wall, is more than sufficient to keep
the barbarous <a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>tale alive, of how some five hundred Jews of all ages
and sexes fled for protection to the Castle keep, and were
besieged there for days by Christians, thirsting for their
blood.&nbsp; Their death was sure: only the manner of it remained
uncertain.&nbsp; The wholesale slaughter of Jews at Lynn,
Lincoln, and Stamford rendered surrender impossible, and rather
than die slowly in the agonies of starvation they set the Castle
on fire, husbands and brothers slaying the women and children,
and then stabbing themselves.&nbsp; Those few who feared to die
thus opened the gates as morning dawned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Affliction
has taught us wisdom,&rdquo; they said, &ldquo;and we long for
baptism and for the faith and peace of Christ&rdquo;; but even as
they said it the swords and axes of ruthless assassins struck
them down.&nbsp; Christ was avenged, and, incidentally, many a
Christian debtor cried quits with his Jewish creditor as he
dashed out the infidel&rsquo;s brains.&nbsp; It is not often
given to champions of causes, religious or political, to make one
blow serve both public and private ends, and those Christians
were fortunate.&nbsp; At the same time, sympathy with the
murdered Jews may easily be overstrained.&nbsp; They had but sown
the wind and reaped the whirlwind.&nbsp; Trading and following
the traditional Jewish occupation of usury, they had eaten like a
canker into the heart of York.&nbsp; They had lived in princely
style, and knew how to grind the faces of their Christian
debtors, whose lives they had made miserable, and so simply fell
victims to that revenge which has been aptly described as
&ldquo;a kind of wild justice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Clifford&rsquo;s Tower, standing where these scenes were
enacted, is a roofless shell, standing isolated on its mound
within the Castle walls, and obtains its name, not from its
builder, but from Francis Clifford, Earl of Cumberland, who made
a doorway in it in the time of Charles the First.&nbsp; It was
ruined by explosion and fire in 1684, and so remains, shattered
and overgrown with trees and grass, a picturesque object that the
eye loves to linger upon in contrast with the classic <a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>buildings
that occupy the old Castle wards, and speak of crime and its
penalties.&nbsp; He who would bring back the crimes and
ferocities of a hundred and fifty years or more to the
mind&rsquo;s eye can have his taste gratified and the most vivid
pictures conjured up at the sight of such choice and thrilling
relics as the horn-handled knife and fork with which the bodies
of rebels captured in the &rsquo;45 were quartered; the leathern
strap that Holroyd used for the purpose of hanging his father
from the boughs of a cherry-tree; a fragment of the skull of
Eugene Aram&rsquo;s victim, Daniel Clark; the curiously varied
implements used by wives and husbands who murdered their
yoke-fellows, ranging from the unwifely sledge-hammer and razor
wielded by wives, to the knives and pokers chiefly affected by
the husbands; Jonathan Martin the incendiary&rsquo;s impromptu
flint and steel, and the bell rope by whose aid he escaped from
the Minster; and those prime curiosities, Dick Turpin&rsquo;s
fetters.&nbsp; Even Turpin&rsquo;s cell <a
name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 15</span>can be seen
by those who, after much diligent application to the Prisons
Department of the Home Office, procure the <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
to the Castle; and in that &ldquo;stone jug,&rdquo; as the
criminals of old called their cells, the imaginative can
reconstruct their Turpin as they will.&nbsp; Many a better man
than he has occupied this gloomy dungeon, but scarce a worse.</p>

<h2>III</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">One</span> of the most notorious of the
criminals who were haled forth from this condemned hold to end
their days on Knavesmire was Richard Turpin, who was hanged on
the 17th of April, 1739.&nbsp; This cruel and mean ruffian,
around whose sordid career the glamour of countless legends of
varying degrees of impossibility has gathered, was the son of a
small innkeeper and farmer at the appropriately named village of
Hempstead, in Essex.&nbsp; The inn, called the
&ldquo;Crown,&rdquo; almost wholly rebuilt, however, is in
existence to this day, and his baptismal record may yet be read
in the parish register:&mdash;&ldquo;1705, Sept. 21,
<i>Richardus</i>, <i>filius Johannis et Mariae
Turpin</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Apprenticed to a butcher in Whitechapel, he soon set up in
business for himself, obtaining his cattle by the simple and
ready expedient of stealing them.&nbsp; He married a girl named
Palmer, whose name he afterwards took, and after a career of
house-breaking and cattle-lifting in Essex and parts of
Middlesex, in which he figured as one of a numerous gang who
never attacked or plundered unless they were armed to the teeth
and in a great numerical superiority, found the home counties too
hot to hold him; and so, after shooting his friend, one of the
three brothers King, all highwaymen, in the affray at Whitechapel
in 1737, in which he escaped from the Bow Street officers, he
fled first into Essex and then into Lincolnshire.&nbsp;
Authorities disagree, both as to the particular <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>King who was
shot, and on the question of whether Turpin shot him accidentally
in aiming at one of the officers, or with the purpose of
preventing him giving evidence disclosing his haunts.&nbsp; The
legends make Tom King the martyr on this occasion, and represent
him as bidding Turpin to fly; but the facts seem to point to
Matthew being the victim, and to his cursing Turpin for a coward,
as he died.&nbsp; It is quite certain that a Tom King, a
highwayman, suffered at Tyburn in 1755, eight years later.</p>
<p>As for Turpin, or Palmer, as he now called himself, he settled
at Welton, near Beverley, and then at Long Sutton, Lincolnshire,
as a gentleman horse-dealer.&nbsp; He had not long been domiciled
in those parts before the farmers and others began to lose their
stock in a most unaccountable manner.&nbsp; The wonder is that no
one suspected him, and that he could manage, for however short a
period, to safely sell the many horses he stole.&nbsp; He even
managed to mix freely in company with the yeomen of the district,
and despite his ill-favoured countenance, made himself not
unwelcome.&nbsp; But his brutal nature was the cause of his
undoing.&nbsp; Returning from a shooting excursion, he wantonly
shot one of his neighbour&rsquo;s fowls, and on being
remonstrated with, threatened to serve one of his new friends the
same.&nbsp; He was accordingly summoned at the Beverley Petty
Sessions, when it appeared that he had no friends to find bail
for him, and that he was, in point of fact, a newcomer to the
district, whose habits, now investigated for the first time,
proved suspicious.&nbsp; Eventually he was charged with stealing
a black mare, blind of the near eye, off Heckington Common, and
was committed to York Castle.&nbsp; From his dungeon cell he
wrote a letter to his brother at Hempstead, to cook him up a
character.&nbsp; The letter was not prepaid, and the brother, not
recognising the handwriting, refused to pay the sixpence demanded
by the Post Office.&nbsp; On such trivial things do great issues
hang!&nbsp; The village postmaster happened to have been the
schoolmaster who had taught Turpin to write.&nbsp; He recognised
the <a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>handwriting and read the letter.&nbsp; He was a man of
public spirit, and, travelling to York, identified the prisoner
as the Richard Turpin who had long been &ldquo;wanted&rdquo; for
many crimes.</p>
<p>After his trial and condemnation the farmers flocked in
hundreds to see him.&nbsp; His last days in prison were as well
attended as a levee, and, to do him justice, his courage,
conspicuously lacking at other times, never faltered at the
last.&nbsp; He became one of the shows of that ancient city for a
time, but nothing daunted him.&nbsp; He spent his last days in
joking, drinking, and telling stories, as jovial, merry, and
frolicsome as though the shadow of the gallows was not impending
over him.&nbsp; He scouted the Ordinary, and suffered no twinges
of conscience, but busied himself in preparing a decent costume
for his last public appearance.&nbsp; Nothing would serve him but
new clothes and a smart pair of pumps to die in.&nbsp; On the
morning before the execution, he gave the hangman &pound;3. 10s.
to be divided among five men who were to follow him as mourners,
and were to be furnished with black hatbands and mourning
gloves.&nbsp; When the time came and he went in the tumbril to be
turned off, he bowed to the ladies and flourished his cocked hat
as though he would presently see them again.&nbsp; He certainly,
when he had mounted the ladder, kept the people waiting for the
spectacle they had come to see, for he talked with the hangman
for over half-an-hour.&nbsp; But when the conversation was ended,
he threw himself off in the most resolute fashion, and had the
reward of his courage, for he died in a moment.</p>
<p>Thus died the famous Turpin, in the thirty-third year of his
age.&nbsp; After the execution his body lay in state for that day
and the succeeding night at the &ldquo;Black Boar&rdquo; inn in
Castlegate.&nbsp; The following morning it was buried in the
churchyard of St. George&rsquo;s, by Fishergate Postern, and the
evening afterwards it was dug up again by some of the city
surgeons, for dissection.&nbsp; By this time the mob had
apparently agreed that this brutal horse-stealer, who according
<a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 18</span>to the
contemporary <i>London Magazine</i>, was &ldquo;so mean and
stupid a wretch,&rdquo; was really a very fine fellow; and they
determined that his remains should not be dishonoured.&nbsp;
Accordingly they rescued the body and reinterred it, in black
lime, so as to effectually balk any further attempts on the part
of the surgeons.</p>
<p>Dick Turpin, although his name bulks so largely in the
legendary story of the roads, was by no means the foremost of his
profession.&nbsp; He was brutal, and lacked the finer instincts
of the artist.&nbsp; It could never, for instance, have been in
his nature to invite the wife of a traveller he had just robbed
to dance a coranto with him on the Common, as Duval did on
Hounslow Heath when the distant clocks were sounding the hour of
midnight.&nbsp; With Turpin it was an oath and a blow.&nbsp;
Curses and violence, not courtesy, were his methods.&nbsp;
Therefore, it is with the less compunction that we may tear away
the romance from Richard Turpin and say that, so far from being
the hero of the Ride to York, he never rode to York at all,
except on that fatal morning when he progressed to York Castle in
chains, presently to be convicted and hanged for the unromantic
crimes of horse, sheep, and cattle stealing.&nbsp; He was little
better than a vulgar burglar and horse-thief.&nbsp; It was
Harrison Ainsworth who made Turpin a hero from such very
unpromising material, and he, in fact, invented not only the ride
to York, but Black Bess as well.&nbsp; According to the novelist,
Turpin started from Kilburn, and came into the Great North Road
at Highgate, with three mounted officers after him.&nbsp; Thence
he turned into Hornsey, and so by the Ware route, the mare
clearing the twelve feet high toll-gate on the way without an
effort.&nbsp; They always do that in fiction, but the animal that
could do it in fact does not exist.</p>
<p>At Tottenham (always according to the novelist, of course) the
people threw brickbats at the gallant Turpin.&nbsp; They
&ldquo;showered thick as hail, and quite as harmlessly, around
him,&rdquo; and Turpin laughed, as, <a name="page19"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 19</span>indeed, he had an occasion to do,
because the Tottenham people must have been the poorest of
marksmen.&nbsp; And so pursuers and pursued swept through
Edmonton and Ware, and quite a number of places which are not on
our route.&nbsp; At Alconbury Hill he comes into view again, and
the inconceivable chase proceeds until Black Bess expires, at
sunrise, within sight of the glorious panorama of York&rsquo;s
spires and towers.</p>
<p>There are very many who believe Ainsworth&rsquo;s long
rigmarole, and take their ideas of that unromantic highwayman
from his novel, but the dashing, highsouled (and at times
maudlin) fellow of those pages is absolutely fictitious.</p>
<h2>IV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Ainsworth</span> constructed his
fictitious hero from a very slight basis of fact.&nbsp; What a
pity he did not rear his narrative on better lines, and give the
credit of the Ride to York to the man who really did it.&nbsp;
For it was done, and it was a longer ride by some twenty-six
miles, at least, than that recounted in the vulgar romance of
<i>Rookwood</i>.&nbsp; It was, in fact, a better ride, by a
better man, and at a much earlier period.</p>
<p>John Nevison was the hero of this exploit.&nbsp; It was on a
May morning in 1676, at the unconscionable hour of four
o&rsquo;clock, that he robbed a traveller on Gad&rsquo;s Hill,
near Chatham, and, fired with the ambition of establishing an
alibi, immediately set off to ride to York.&nbsp; Crossing the
Thames from Gravesend to Tilbury, he rode on his &ldquo;blood
bay&rdquo; to Chelmsford, where he baited and rested his horse
for half-an-hour.&nbsp; Thence on to Cambridge and through the
town without drawing rein, he went through by-lanes to Fenny
Stanton, Godmanchester, and Huntingdon, where he took another
half-hour&rsquo;s rest; continuing, by unfrequented ways, until
York was reached, the same evening.&nbsp; Of course, he must have
had several fresh horses on the way.&nbsp; Stabling the horse
that had brought <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>him into the cathedral city, he hastily removed the
travel-stains from his person, and strolled casually to the
nearest bowling-green, where the Mayor of York happened to be
playing a game with some friends.&nbsp; Nevison took the
opportunity of asking him the time, and received the answer that
it was just a quarter to eight.&nbsp; That was sufficient for his
purpose.&nbsp; By this question and the reply he had fixed the
recollection of himself and of the time in the Mayor&rsquo;s
mind, and had his <i>alibi</i> at need.&nbsp; Sure enough, he
needed it a little later, when he was arrested for another
highway robbery, and the Gad&rsquo;s Hill traveller happened to
be the one witness who could swear to him.&nbsp; Nevison called
his York witnesses, who readily enough deposed to his being there
on the evening of the day on which the traveller swore he had
been robbed by him near Chatham.&nbsp; This was conclusive.&nbsp;
No one conceived it possible for a man to have been in two places
so remote in one day, and he was acquitted.&nbsp; Then, when the
danger was past, his sporting instincts prevailed, and he told
the story.&nbsp; He became the hero of a brief hour, and Charles
the Second, who dearly loved a clever rogue, is said to have
christened him &ldquo;Swift Nicks.&rdquo;&nbsp; If we roughly
analyse this ride we shall find that Nevison&rsquo;s performance
amounted to about 230 miles in fifteen hours: a rate of over
fifteen miles an hour.&nbsp; To have done as much was a wonderful
exploit, even though (as seems certain) he had remounts at the
houses of confederates.&nbsp; He probably had many such houses of
call, for he was one of a numerous band of highwaymen whose
headquarters were at Newark.</p>
<p>This escape served him for eight years longer, for it was in
1684 that his career came to a close on Knavesmire, where he was
hanged on the 4th of May.</p>
<p>There was something of the Robin Hood in Nevison&rsquo;s
character, if we are to believe the almost legendary stories told
in Yorkshire of this darling of the Yorkshire peasantry.&nbsp; He
robbed the rich and gave to the poor, and many are the tales
still told of his generosity.&nbsp; <a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>Such an one is the tale that tells of
his being at a village inn, when the talk turned upon the affairs
of an unfortunate farmer whose home had been sold up for
rent.&nbsp; Among those in the place was the bailiff, with the
proceeds of the sale on him.&nbsp; Nevison contrived to relieve
him of the cash, and restored it to the farmer.&nbsp; Perhaps he
was not so well-liked by the cattle-dealers along the Great North
Road, whom he and his gang robbed so regularly that at length
they commuted their involuntary contributions for a quarterly
allowance, which at the same time cleared the road for them and
afforded them protection against any other bands.&nbsp; Indeed,
Nevison, or Bracy, as his real name appears to have been, was in
this respect almost a counterpart of those old German barons on
the Rhine, who levied dues on the travellers whose business
unfortunately led them their way.&nbsp; The parallel goes no
greater distance, for those picturesque miscreants were anything
but the idols of the people.&nbsp; Nevison was sufficiently
popular to have been the hero of a rural ballad, still
occasionally heard in the neighbourhood of his haunts at
Knaresborough, Ferrybridge, York, or Newark.&nbsp; Here are two
verses of it; not perhaps distinguished by wealth of fancy or
resourcefulness of rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Did you ever hear tell of that hero;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Bold Nevison, that was his name?<br />
He rode about like a bold hero,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And with that he gain&rsquo;d great fame.</p>
<p>He maintained himself like a gentleman,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Besides, he was good to the poor;<br />
He rode about like a great hero,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And he gain&rsquo;d himself favour therefore.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yorkshire will not willingly let the fame of her Nevison
die.&nbsp; Is not his Leap shown, and is not the inn at Sandal,
where he was last captured, still pointed out?&nbsp; Then there
is the tale of how he and twenty of his gang attacked fifteen
butchers who were riding to Northallerton Fair, an encounter
recounted in a pamphlet dated 1674, luridly styled <i>Bloody News
from Yorkshire</i>.&nbsp; Another memory is of the half <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>dozen men who
at another time attempted to take him prisoner.&nbsp; He escaped
and shot one of them, also a butcher.&nbsp; Nevison and butchers
were evidently antipathetic.&nbsp; Released once on promising to
enter the army, he, like Boulter, deserted.&nbsp; That he could
break prison with the best he demonstrated fully at Wakefield;
but his final capture was on a trivial charge.&nbsp; It sufficed
to do his business, though, for the prosecution were now prepared
with the fullest evidence against him and his associates, and
their way of life.&nbsp; They had secured Mary Brandon, who acted
as housekeeper for the gang.&nbsp; According to her story, they
were John Nevison, of York; Edmund Bracy, of Nottingham; Thomas
Wilbere, of the same town; Thomas Tankard, vaguely described as
&ldquo;of Lincolnshire&rdquo;; and two men named Bromett and
Iverson.&nbsp; This last was &ldquo;commonly at the
&lsquo;Talbott,&rsquo; in Newarke,&rdquo; which was their
headquarters.&nbsp; The landlord of that inn was supposed to be
cognisant of their doings, as also the ostler, one William
Anwood, &ldquo;shee haveinge often scene the said partyes give
him good summs of money, and order him to keepe their horses
close, and never to water them but in the night
time.&rdquo;&nbsp; They kept rooms at the &ldquo;Talbot&rdquo;
all the year round, and in them divided their spoil, which in one
year, as the result of ten great robberies, came to over
&pound;1,500.&nbsp; No other highwaymen can hold a candle to this
gang, either for their business-like habits or the success of
their operations.</p>
<h2>V</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">That</span> once dreaded mid-eighteenth
century highwayman, Thomas Boulter, junior, of Poulshot in
Wiltshire, once made acquaintance with York Castle.&nbsp; The
extent of his depredations was as wide as his indifference to
danger was great.&nbsp; A West-countryman, his most obvious
sphere of operations was the country through which the Exeter
Road passed; but being greedy and <a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>insatiable, he soon exhausted those
districts, and thought it expedient to strike out for roads where
the name of Boulter was unknown, and along which the lieges still
dared to carry their watches and their gold.&nbsp; He came up to
town at the beginning of 1777 from his haunts near Devizes, and,
refitting in apparel and pistols, gaily took the Great North
Road.&nbsp; Many adventures and much spoil fell to him in and
about Newark, Leeds, and Doncaster; but an encounter between
Sheffield and Ripon proved his undoing.&nbsp; He had relieved a
gentleman on horseback of purse and jewellery, and was ambling
negligently away when the traveller&rsquo;s man-servant, who had
fallen some distance behind his master, came galloping up.&nbsp;
Thus reinforced, the plundered one chased Mr. Boulter, and,
running him to earth, haled him off to the nearest Justice, who,
quite unmoved by his story of being an unfortunate young man in
the grocery line, appropriately enough named Poore, committed him
to York Castle, where, at the March assizes, he was duly found
guilty and sentenced to be hanged within fifteen days.&nbsp;
Heavily ironed, escape was out of the question, and he gave
himself up for lost, until, on the morning appointed for his
execution, the news arrived that he might claim a free pardon if
he would enter his Majesty&rsquo;s service as a soldier, and
reform his life.&nbsp; His Majesty badly wanted soldiers in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 1777, and was not nice as to the
character of his recruits; and indeed the British army until the
close of the Peninsular War was composed of as arrant a set of
rascals as ever wore out shoe-leather.&nbsp; No wonder the Duke
of Wellington spoke of his army in Spain as &ldquo;my
blackguards.&rdquo;&nbsp; But they could fight.</p>
<p>This by the way.&nbsp; To return to Mr. Thomas Boulter, who,
full of moral resolutions and martial ardour, now joined the
first marching regiment halting at York.&nbsp; For four days he
toiled and strove in the barrack-yard, finding with every hour
the burdens of military life growing heavier.&nbsp; On the fifth
day he determined to desert, and on the sixth put that
determination into <a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>practice; for if he had waited until the morrow, when
his uniform would have been ready, escape would have been
difficult.&nbsp; Stealing forth at dead of night, without mishap,
he made across country to Nottingham, and so disappears
altogether from these pages.&nbsp; The further deeds that he did,
and the story of his end are duly chronicled in the pages of the
<i>Exeter Road</i>, to which they properly belong.</p>
<p>The authorities did well to secure their criminal prisoners
with irons, because escape seems to have otherwise been easy
enough.&nbsp; In 1761, for instance, there were a hundred and
twenty-one French prisoners of war confined in York Castle, and
such captives were of course not ironed.&nbsp; Some of them filed
through the bars of their prison and twenty escaped.&nbsp; Of
these, six were recaptured, but the rest were never again heard
of, which seems to be proof that the prison was scarcely worthy
of the name, and that the city of York contained traitors who
secretly conveyed the fugitives away to the coast.</p>
<p>The troubles and escapades of military captives are all in the
course of their career, and provoke interested sympathy but not
compassion, because we know full well that they would do the same
to their foes, did fortune give the opportunity.&nbsp; Altogether
different was the position of the unfortunate old women who,
ill-favoured or crazy, were charged on the evidence of ill-looks
or silly talk with being witches, and thrown into the noisome
cells that existed here for such.&nbsp; Theirs were sad cases,
for the world took witchcraft seriously and burnt or strangled
those alleged practitioners of it who had survived being
&ldquo;swum&rdquo; in the river close by.&nbsp; The humour of
that old method of trying an alleged witch was grimly
sardonic.&nbsp; She was simply thrown into the water, and if she
sank was innocent.&nbsp; If, on the other hand, she floated, that
was proof that Satan was protecting his own, and she was fished
out and barbarously put to death.&nbsp; Trials for witchcraft
were continued until long after the absurdity of the charges
became apparent, <a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>and judges simply treated the accusations with humorous
contempt: as when a crazy old woman who pretended to supernatural
powers was brought before Judge Powell.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you say
you can fly?&rdquo; asked the Judge, interposing.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Yes, I can,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;So you may, if
you will then,&rdquo; rejoined that dry humorist.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have no law against it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The accused did not respond
to the invitation.</p>
<p>So farewell, grim Castle of York, old-time prison of such
strangely assorted captives as religious pioneers, poor debtors,
highwaymen, prisoners of war, and suspected witches; and modern
gaol whose romance is concealed beneath contemporary
common-places.&nbsp; Blood stains your stones, and persecution is
writ large on the page of your story.&nbsp; Infidel Jews,
Protestants, Catholics, and Nonconformists of every shade of
nonconformity have suffered within your walls in greater or less
degree, and even now the black flag occasionally floats
dolorously in the breeze from your roofs, in token that the
penalty for the crime of Cain has been exacted.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before</span> railways came and rendered
London the chief resort of fashion, county towns, and many lesser
towns still, were social centres.&nbsp; Only the wealthier among
the country squires and those interested in politics to the
extent of having a seat in the House visited London; the rest
resorted to their county town, in which they had their
town-houses and social circles.&nbsp; Those times are to be found
reflected in the pages of Jane Austen and other early novelists,
who picture for us the snug coteries that then flourished and the
romances that ran their course within the unromantic-looking
Georgian mansions now either occupied by local professional men
or wealthy trades-folk, or else divided into tenements.&nbsp; It
was the era before great suburbs began to spring up around <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>every
considerable town, to smother the historic in the commonplace;
the time before manufacturing industries arose to smirch the
countryside and to rot the stonework of ancient buildings with
smoke and acid-laden air; the days when life was less hurried
than now.&nbsp; York, two days&rsquo; journey removed from
London, had its own society and a very varied one, consisting of
such elements as the Church, the Army, and the Landed Interest,
which last must also be expressed in capital letters, because in
those days to be a Landowner was a patent of gentility.&nbsp;
Outside these elements, excepting the dubious ones of the Legal
and Medical professions, there was no society.&nbsp; Trade
rendered the keepers of second-hand clothes-shops and wealthy
manufacturers equally pariahs and put them outside the pale of
polite intercourse.&nbsp; Society played whist in drawing-rooms;
tradesmen played quoits, bowls, or skittles in grounds attached
to inns, or passed their evenings in convivial
bar-parlours.&nbsp; Yet York must have been a noted place for
conviviality, if we are to believe the old poet:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>York, York for my monie,<br />
Of all the cities that ever I see,<br />
For merry pastime and companie,<br />
Except the citie of London.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And for long after those lines were written they held
good.&nbsp; Not many other cities had York&rsquo;s advantages as
a great military headquarters, as well as the head of an
ecclesiastical Province, and its position as a great coaching
centre to and from which came and went away many other coaches
besides those which fared the Great North Road was
commanding.&nbsp; Cross-country coach-routes radiated from the
old cathedral city in every direction; just as, in fact, the
railways do nowadays.&nbsp; It is no part of our business to
particularise them, but the inns they frequented demand a
notice.&nbsp; Some of these inns were solely devoted to posting,
which in this broad-acred county of wealthy squires was not
considered the extravagance that less fortunate folks thought
it.&nbsp; Chief among <a name="page27"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 27</span>these was&mdash;alas! that we must
say <i>was</i>&mdash;the &ldquo;George,&rdquo; which stood almost
exactly opposite the still extant &ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo; in
Coney Street.&nbsp; A flaunting pile of business premises
occupied by a firm of drapers now usurps the site of that
extremely picturesque old house which rejoiced in a
sixteenth-century frontage, heavily gabled and enriched with
quaint designs in plaster, and a yawning archway, supported on
either side by curious figures whose lower anatomy ended in
scrolls, after the manner of the Renaissance.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;George&rdquo; for many years enjoyed an unexampled
prosperity, and the adjoining houses, of early Georgian date,
with projecting colonnade, were annexed to it.&nbsp; When it
went, to make way for new buildings, York lost its most
picturesque inn, for the York Tavern, now Harker&rsquo;s Hotel,
though solid, comfortable, and prosperous-looking, with its
cleanly stucco front, is not interesting, and the &ldquo;Black
Swan&rdquo; is a typical redbrick building of two hundred years
ago, square as a box, and as little decorative as it could
possibly be.&nbsp; As for the aristocratic Etteridge&rsquo;s,
which stood in Lendal, it may be sought in vain in that largely
rebuilt quarter.&nbsp; Etteridge&rsquo;s not only disdained the
ordinary coaching business, but also jibbed at the average
posting people&mdash;or, perhaps, to put it more correctly, even
the wealthy squires who flung away their money on posting stood
aghast at Etteridge&rsquo;s prices.&nbsp; Therefore, in those
days, when riches and gentility went together&mdash;before the
self-made millionaires had risen, like scum, to the
top&mdash;Etteridge&rsquo;s entertained the most select, who
travelled in their own &ldquo;chariots,&rdquo; and were horsed on
their almost royal progresses by Etteridge and his like.</p>
<p>From the purely coaching point of view, the &ldquo;Black
Swan&rdquo; is the most interesting of York&rsquo;s
hostelries.&nbsp; To the York Tavern came the mails, while the
&ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo; did the bulk of the stage-coach
business, from the beginning of it in 1698 until the end, in
1842.&nbsp; It was here that the old &ldquo;York in Four
Days&rdquo; coaching bill of 1706 was discovered some years
ago.&nbsp; The house <a name="page28"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 28</span>remained one of the very few
unaltered inns of coaching days, the stableyard the same as it
was a hundred years or more since, even to the weather-beaten old
painted oval sign of the &ldquo;Black Swan,&rdquo; removed from
the front and nailed over one of the stable-doors.</p>
<p>York still preserves memories of the old coachmen; some of
them very great in their day.&nbsp; Tom Holtby&rsquo;s, for
instance, is a classic figure, and one that remained until long
after coaching came to an end.&nbsp; He died in June 1863, in his
seventy-second year, and was therefore, not greatly beyond his
prime when he drove the Edinburgh mail into York for the last
time, in 1842, on the opening of the railway.&nbsp; That last
drive was an occasion not to be passed without due ceremony, and
so when the mail, passing through Selby and Riccall, on its way
to the city, reached Escrick Park, it was driven through, by Lord
Wenlock&rsquo;s invitation, and accompanied by him on his drag up
to the &ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo; and to the York Tavern.&nbsp; The
mail flew a black flag from its roof, and Holtby gave up the
reins to Lord Macdonald.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Please to remember the coachman,&rdquo; said my lord to
Holtby, in imitation of the professional&rsquo;s usual
formula.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Holtby, &ldquo;I will,
if you&rsquo;ll remember the guard.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; said that innocent nobleman, not thinking
for the moment that coachmen and guards shared their tips;
&ldquo;he shall have double what you tip me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Holtby
accordingly handed him a &pound;5 note, so that he reaped a
profit of &pound;2. 10s. on the business.</p>
<p>Holtby&rsquo;s career was as varied as many of the old
coachmen&rsquo;s, but more prosperous.&nbsp; He began as a
stable-hand at the &ldquo;Rose and Crown,&rdquo; Easingwold, and
rose to be a postboy.&nbsp; Thence to the box of a cross-country
coach was an easy transition, and his combined dash and certainty
as a whip at last found him a place on the London and Edinburgh
&ldquo;Highflyer,&rdquo; whence he was transferred to the
mail.&nbsp; During these years he had saved money, and was a
comparatively rich man when coaching ended; so that although <a
name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 29</span>he lost some
heavy sums in ill-judged investments, still he died worth over
&pound;3,000.&nbsp; &ldquo;Rash Tom,&rdquo; as they called him,
from his showy style of driving, was indeed something of a
&ldquo;Corinthian,&rdquo; and coming into contact with the high
and mighty of that era, reflected their manners and shared their
tastes.&nbsp; If the reflection, like that of a wavy mirror, was
not quite perfect, and erred rather in the direction of
caricature, that was a failing not found in Tom only, and was
accordingly overlooked.&nbsp; Moreover, Tom was useful.&nbsp; No
man could break in a horse like him, and nowhere was a better
tutor in the art of driving.&nbsp; &ldquo;If,&rdquo; said Old
Jerry, &ldquo;Tom Holtby didn&rsquo;t live on potato-skins and
worn&rsquo;t such a one for lickin&rsquo; folks&rsquo; boots,
he&rsquo;d be perfect.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Old Jerry,&rdquo; who
probably had some professional grudge against Holtby, referred to
potato-skins as well as to boot-licking in a figurative
way.&nbsp; He meant to satirise Holtby as a saving man and as an
intimate of those who at the best treated Jerry himself with
obvious condescension.&nbsp; Jerry himself was one of the most
famous of postboys, and remained for long years in the service of
the &ldquo;Black Swan.&rdquo;&nbsp; The burden of his old age was
the increasing meanness of the times.&nbsp; &ldquo;Them wor
graand toimes for oos!&rdquo; he would say, in his Yorkshire
lingo, talking of the early years of the nineteenth century, and
so they must have been, for that was the tail-end of the era when
all England went mad over Parliamentary elections, and when
Yorkshire, the biggest of all the counties, was the
maddest.&nbsp; Everybody posted, money was spent like water on
bribery and corruption, and on more reputable items of
expenditure, and postboys shared in the golden shower.</p>
<h2>VII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> most exciting of these Homeric
election contests was the fierce election for Yorkshire in
1807.&nbsp; At that time the huge county, larger than any other
two <a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>counties put together, returned only two representatives
to Parliament, and the City of York was the sole
voting-place.&nbsp; Yorkshire, roughly measuring eighty miles
from north to south, and another eighty from east to west, must
have contained ardent politicians if its out-voters appeared at
the poll in any strength.&nbsp; But if polling-places were to
seek and voting the occasion of a weary pilgrimage, at least the
authorities could not be accused of allowing too little time for
the exercise of that political right.&nbsp; The booths remained
open for fifteen days.&nbsp; William Wilberforce had for years
been the senior member, and had hitherto held a secure
position.&nbsp; On this particular occasion the contest lay
between the rival houses of Fitzwilliam and Lascelles, Whigs and
Tories respectively, intent upon capturing the junior seat.&nbsp;
Lord Milton, the eldest son of Earl Fitzwilliam, and the
Honourable Henry Lascelles, heir to the Earl of Harewood, were
the candidates.&nbsp; Lord Harewood expressed his intention of
expending, if necessary, the whole of his Barbados estates, worth
&pound;40,000 a year, to secure his son&rsquo;s return, and equal
determination was shown by the other side.&nbsp; With such
opponents, it was little wonder that Yorkshire was turned into a
pandemonium for over a fortnight.&nbsp; All kinds of vehicles,
from military wagons, family chariots, and mourning-coaches at
one extreme, to sedan-chairs and donkey-carts at the other, were
pressed into service.&nbsp; Invalids and even those <i>in
articulo mortis</i> were herded up to the poll.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No such scene,&rdquo; said a Yorkshire paper,
&ldquo;had been witnessed in these islands for a hundred years as
the greatest county in them presented for fifteen days and
nights.&nbsp; Repose and rest have been unknown, unless
exemplified by postboys asleep in the saddle.&nbsp; Every day and
every night the roads leading to York have been covered by
vehicles of all kinds loaded with voters&mdash;barouches,
curricles, gigs, coaches, landaus, dog-carts, flying wagons,
mourning-coaches, and military cars with eight horses, have left
no chance for <a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>the quiet traveller to pursue his humble journey in
peace, or to find a chair at an inn to sit down upon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a result, Wilberforce kept his place, Viscount Milton was
elected second, and Lascelles was rejected.&nbsp; The figures
were:&mdash;</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><p>Wilberforce</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">11,806</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Milton</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">11,177</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><p>Lascelles</p>
</td>
<td><p style="text-align: right">10,988</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Only some thirty-four thousand voters in the great shire!</p>
<p>It was said that Earl Fitzwilliam&rsquo;s expenses were
&pound;107,000 and his unsuccessful opponent&rsquo;s
&pound;102,000.&nbsp; Wilberforce, who in the fray only narrowly
kept at the head of the poll, was at little expense, a public
subscription which reached the sum of &pound;64,455 having been
made on his behalf.&nbsp; A great portion of it was afterwards
returned by him.&nbsp; He afterwards wrote that had he not been
defrauded of promised votes, his total would have reached
20,000.&nbsp; &ldquo;However,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;it is
unspeakable cause for thankfulness to come out of the battle
ruined neither in health, character, or fortune.&rdquo;&nbsp; It
was in this election that a voter who had plumped for Wilberforce
and had come a long distance for the purpose, boasting that he
had not spent anything on the journey, was asked how he managed
it.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sure enow,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I cam all
d&rsquo;way ahint Lord Milton&rsquo;s carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A story is told of a bye-election impending in Yorkshire, in
which Pitt had particularly interested himself.&nbsp; Just upon
the eve of the polling he paid a visit to the famous Mrs.
B&mdash;, one of the Whig queens of the West Riding, and said,
banteringly, &ldquo;Well, the election is all right for us.&nbsp;
Ten thousand guineas for the use of our side go down to Yorkshire
to-night by a sure hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil they do!&rdquo; responded Mrs. B&mdash;; and
that night the bearer of the precious burden was stopped by a
highwayman on the Great North Road, <a name="page32"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 32</span>and the ten thousand guineas procured
the return of the Whig candidate.&nbsp; The success of that
robbery was probably owing to the &ldquo;sure hand&rdquo;
travelling alone.&nbsp; Had he gone by mail-coach, the party
funds would have been safe, if we may rely upon the <i>bona
fides</i> of the York Post Office notice, dated October 30, 1786,
which was issued for the reassurance of those intending to travel
by mail, and says: &ldquo;Ladies and gentlemen may depend on
every care and attention being paid to their safety.&nbsp; They
will be guarded all the way by His Majesty&rsquo;s servants, and
on dark nights a postillion will ride on one of the
leaders.&rdquo;&nbsp; The notice concluded by saying that the
guard was well armed.&nbsp; This was no excess of caution, or
merely issued to still the nerves of timid old ladies, for at
this period we find &ldquo;safety&rdquo; coaches advertised,
&ldquo;lined with copper, and secure against bullets&rdquo;; and
recorded encounters with armed highwaymen prove that these
precautions were not unnecessary.</p>
<h2>VIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">York Minster</span>, although so huge and
imposing a pile when reached, is not glimpsed by the traveller
approaching the city from the Selby route until well within the
streets, and only when Knavesmire is passed on the Tadcaster
route are its three towers seen rising far behind the time-worn
turrets of Micklegate Bar.&nbsp; In bulk, it is in the very front
rank among English cathedrals, but the flatness of its site and
the narrow streets that lead to the Minster Yard render it quite
inconspicuous from any distance, except from a few selected
points and from the commanding eyrie of the City Walls, whence,
indeed, it is seen at its grandest.&nbsp; &ldquo;Minster&rdquo;
it has been named from time immemorial, but for no apparent
reason, for York&rsquo;s Chapter was one of secular priests, and
as the term &ldquo;minster&rdquo; derives from
&ldquo;monasterium,&rdquo; <a name="page35"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 35</span>this is clearly a misnomer.&nbsp; But
as the larger churches were those in connection with monastic
rule, it must have seemed in the popular view that this gigantic
church was rightly a Minster, no matter what its government.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image33" href="images/p33.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>It lies quite away from the tortuous streets by which the
traveller proceeds through York for the road to the North, and it
is only when nearly leaving the city by Bootham Bar that glimpses
of its grey bulk are seen, at the end of some narrow lane like
Stonegate or Petergate, framed in by old gabled houses that lean
upon each other in every attitude suggesting age and decay, or
seem to nod owlishly to neighbours just as decrepit across the
cobble-stoned path.&nbsp; These be ideal surroundings.&nbsp; In
the ancient shops, too, are things of rarity and price, artfully
displayed to the gaze of unwary purchasers who do not know the
secrets of the trade in antiques and curiosities, and are quite
ignorant of the fact that they pay twice or thrice the value at
such places as these for the old china, the silver, the chairs,
and bookcases of quaint design that take their fancy.&nbsp; Only
a narrow space prevents the stranger from butting up against the
Minster, at the end of these lanes, for here at York we find no
such wide and grassy Cathedral close as that of Winchester, or
those of Canterbury, Wells, or Peterborough.&nbsp; Just a paved
yard, extremely narrow along the whole south side and to the
east, with a broader paved space at the west front, and some
mingled lawns and pavements to the north, where dwell the Dean,
the prebendaries, and suchlike: these are the surroundings of the
Minster, which render it almost impossible to gain a
comprehensive view of any part save the west front.</p>
<p>The Minster&mdash;the Cathedral Church of St. Peter, to call
it by its proper title&mdash;is the fifth building on this
site.&nbsp; First of all in the series was the wooden chapel
erected for the baptism of Edwin, the Saxon king, in <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 627, followed by a stone church,
begun by him in 628 and completed eight years later by King
Oswald, <a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>who placed the head of Edwin, slain in battle by the
heathen at Hatfield near Doncaster, here in the chapel of St.
Gregory.&nbsp; Thirty-five years later this second church was
found by Wilfrid the Archbishop to be in a state of decay, and he
accordingly repaired the roofs and the walls, which he rendered
&ldquo;whiter than snow by means of white lime,&rdquo; as we are
told by contemporary chroniclers.&nbsp; In point of fact, he
whitewashed the cathedral, just as the churchwardens of a hundred
years ago used to treat our village churches, for which conduct
we have been reviling them for many years past, not knowing that
as whitewashers they could claim such distinguished
kinship.&nbsp; About the year 741 this second building was
destroyed by fire and was replaced by another, completed in 780,
itself burnt in 1069.&nbsp; The fourth was then begun by Thomas
of Bayeux, the first Norman archbishop, and completed about 1080;
to be in its turn partly demolished by Roger Pont
l&rsquo;&Eacute;v&ecirc;que, who about 1170 rebuilt the choir on
a larger scale.&nbsp; Following him came Archbishop Gray, who
rebuilt the south transept in its present form between 1230 and
1241; the north transept and the central tower in its original
form being the work of John Romanus, sub-dean and treasurer from
1228 to 1256.&nbsp; To the son of the sub-dean, Archbishop
Romanus, fell the beginning of a new nave, which was commenced by
him in 1291, but was not completed until 1345, and is the
existing one.&nbsp; All these rebuildings were on a progressive
scale of size and magnificence, and so by the time they had been
completed it happened that Archbishop Roger&rsquo;s Late Norman
choir, which had replaced the smaller Early Norman one by Thomas
of Bayeux, was itself regarded as too small and mean, and so was
pulled down to make room for the existing choir, completed about
1400.&nbsp; Thus the earliest architectural features of the
existing Minster above ground are the Early English transepts,
and nothing remains of those vanished early buildings save some
dubious Saxon masonry and Norman walling in the crypt.</p>
<p><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 37</span>The
first impression gained of the exterior of York Minster&mdash;an
impression which becomes only slightly modified on further
acquaintance&mdash;is that of a vast, rambling, illogical mass of
overdone ornament very much out of repair and very disappointing
to the high expectations formed.&nbsp; Nor is the great central
tower greatly calculated to arouse enthusiasm among those who
know that of Lincoln.&nbsp; An immense mass, whose comparative
scale is best seen from a distance, its severity of outline
borders closely upon clumsiness, a defect which is heightened by
its obviously unfinished condition and the clearly makeshift
battlements that outrage the skyline with an effect as of an
armoured champion wearing feminine headgear.&nbsp; It seems clear
that the intention, either of the original architect of the
tower, in the Early English period, or of those who re-cased it,
some two hundred years later, was to carry it up another
storey.&nbsp; The two western towers belong to much the same
period, the years from 1433 to 1474, and have more than the usual
commonplace appearance of the Perpendicular style.&nbsp; They
form part of the most completely logical west front in England
and almost the least inspired, excepting always that early
Perpendicular fiasco, the west front of Winchester
Cathedral.&nbsp; But the redeeming feature of York&rsquo;s west
front is the beautiful window which, whether regarded from
without or within, is one of the finest details of the building,
its tracery of the flowing Decorated period narrowly approaching
to the French Flamboyant style and resembling in its delicacy and
complicated parts the weblike design seen on the skeleton of a
leaf.</p>
<p>A great portion of the Minster is in the Decorated style; not,
however, conceived in the inspired vein of the west window.&nbsp;
The nave and chapter-house cover the period of the sixty years
during which Decorated Gothic flourished, and making the round of
the exterior we find its characteristic mouldings and traceries
repeated in a long range of seven bays, interrupted by the
beautiful compositions of north and south transepts, entirely
dissimilar from one <a name="page38"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
38</span>another, but individually perfect, and the most entirely
satisfactory features of the exterior.&nbsp; The architects of
that period were more fully endowed with the artistic sense than
those who went before, or those who succeeded them, and their
works, and the more daring and ambitious, but something braggart,
designs of their successors, remain to prove the
contention.&nbsp; Eastward, beyond the transepts, extends the
long, nine-bayed choir, the view of it obscured from the north by
the protruding octagonal chapter-house, but well seen on the
south, where the soaring ambition of its designers may
advantageously be compared with the more modest but better
ordered art of the unknown architect who built the south
transept.&nbsp; The architects of the choir would seem to have
dared their utmost to produce the largest windows with the
smallest proportion of wall-space, and to have at the same time
been emulative of height.&nbsp; With these obvious ambitions,
they have succeeded to wonderment in rearing a building that is
nearly all windows, with an apparently dangerously small
proportion of walling to hold them together, but a building which
has already survived the storms of five hundred years
structurally and essentially sturdy and unimpaired.&nbsp; A great
engineering feat for that time, rather than a masterpiece of
artistry, as those who stand by and compare south transept and
choir, visible in one glance, can see.&nbsp; That the perceptions
of those who built the choir were blunted is proved by the almost
flat roof their ambition for lofty walling has
necessitated.&nbsp; With their side walls carried up to such a
height, abutting against the central tower, they could not obtain
the steep pitch of roof which is seen on the transepts, for a
higher pitch would have committed the architectural solecism of
cutting above the sills of the great tower windows, into the
windows themselves.&nbsp; Thus their lofty choir is robbed of
half its effect and looks square-shouldered and ungraceful by
comparison.</p>
<p>An odd and entirely inexplicable device is found outside the
four eastern windows of the choir clerestory, <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>north and
south, in the placing of the triforium passage outside the
building, and the screening of it and the windows with a great
skeleton framework of stone.&nbsp; The reason of
this&mdash;whether it was a mistaken idea of decoration, or for
some structural strengthening purpose&mdash;is still to be
sought.&nbsp; But the east end is an equally crude and artless
piece of work, almost wholly given up to the east window; the
small flanking windows looking mean and pinched by comparison,
and the abundant decoration characterised by stupid repetition
and want of invention.&nbsp; Here we see the Perpendicular style
at a very low ebb, and thus it is not altogether a disadvantage
that the road is so narrow at this point that a full view of the
east end is difficult to obtain.</p>
<p>Criticism is at once disarmed on entering.&nbsp; One enters,
not by the great portals in the west front, but by the south
porch, the most impressive entrance, as it happens.&nbsp; For
this is at once the noblest and the earliest portion of the great
church, and here, in one magnificent view from south to north we
obtain one of the finest architectural vistas in England.&nbsp;
Majesty personified, these Early English transepts are in
themselves broad and long and lofty enough to furnish a nave for
many another cathedral.&nbsp; Spaciousness and nobility of
proportion are the notes of them, and even the beautiful nave,
with its aisles, light and graceful, loftier and broader than
almost any other in the land, dwindles by comparison.&nbsp; They
produce in the surprised traveller who first beholds them the
rare sensation of satisfaction, of expectations more than
realised, and give an uplifting of spirit as thrilling as that
caused by some inspiring passage of minstrelsy.&nbsp; To stand at
the crossing and gaze upwards into that vast tower which looks so
clumsy to the outward view, is to receive an impression of
beauty, of combined strength and lightness, which is not to be
acquired elsewhere, for it is the finest of lantern towers, and,
open to the vaulting of its roof, a hundred and eighty feet above
the pavement, its great windows on all sides entrap the <a
name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 40</span>sunbeams and
shed a diffused glory on arcade and pier.&nbsp; Perhaps one of
the most daring attempts at effect is that which confronts the
visitor as he enters by the south porch.&nbsp; Daring, not from
the constructional, but from the decorative point of view, the
five equal-sized lancet windows, the &ldquo;Five Sisters&rdquo;
that occupy three parts of the space in the wall of the north
transept, might so easily have been as glaring a failure as they
are a conspicuous success.&nbsp; Their very prominence has
doubtless given them their name, and caused the legend to be
invented of their having been the gift of five maiden
sisters.&nbsp; The beauty of the original Early English glass
which still remains in these lancets has a considerable share in
producing this successful effect.&nbsp; That the unearthly beauty
of that pale green glass is preserved to us, together with much
more in the Minster, is due to Sir Thomas Fairfax, the
Parliamentary general, himself a Yorkshireman, who kept the pious
but narrow-minded and mischievous soldiery in order, who
otherwise would have delighted in flinging prayer-books and
missals through every window in this House of God, and have
accounted it an act of religious fervour.</p>
<p>We cannot explore the Minster in greater detail, for the road
yet lies in many a league before us; nor recount how York, city
and shire, broke into rebellion when the old religion was
suppressed by Henry the Eighth, and the Minster&rsquo;s
treasures, particularly the head of St. William, stolen.&nbsp;
The Pilgrimage of Grace was the result, in which the Yorkshire
gentlemen and others assembled, with Robert Aske at their head,
and taking as their badge the Five Wounds of Christ, prepared to
do battle for their Faith.&nbsp; Aske ended on a gallows from the
height of Micklegate Bar.&nbsp; The same troubles recurred in the
time of Elizabeth, and Yorkshire, the last resort of Roman
Catholicism, was again in arms, with the Earls of Northumberland
and Westmoreland conspiring with the Duke of Norfolk to release
the captive Queen of Scots and restore the old religion.&nbsp;
The movement failed, and Northumberland <a
name="page41"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 41</span>was executed
on the Pavement, others being put to death or deprived of their
estates.&nbsp; That was the last popular movement in favour of
the old faith, and although the city had been prelatical and
Royalist during the first years of Charles the First&rsquo;s
reign, public opinion at last veered completely round, so that
shortly after the Parliamentary victory of Marston Moor in 1644,
and the consequent surrender of the Royalist garrison of York,
the city became as Puritan and republican as it had been the
opposite.&nbsp; Gifts made by Charles to the Minster were torn
down and dispersed, the very font was thrown out, and dean and
chapter were replaced by four divines elected by an
assembly.&nbsp; Many of the York parish churches were wrecked by
fanatics carrying out an order to destroy &ldquo;superstitious
pictures and images,&rdquo; and nearly all were without
incumbents.&nbsp; When the restoration of the monarchy and the
church was effected together in 1661, <a name="page42"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 42</span>York became &ldquo;one of the most
factious and malignant towns in the kingdom,&rdquo; and two years
later broke into a revolt for which twenty-one rebels were
executed.&nbsp; The final outburst occurred in 1688, when James
the Second was suspected of an intention to appoint the Roman
Catholic Bishop of Callipolis to the vacant see of York.&nbsp;
The bishop was taking part in a religious procession through the
streets when an infuriated mob set upon him and seized his
silver-gilt crozier, which was taken as a trophy to the vestry,
where it may yet be seen.&nbsp; The bishop fled.&nbsp; A few days
later James the Second ceased to reign, and with that event ended
these religious contentions.</p>

<h2>IX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> the stirring history of the
Minster itself was not yet completed, for the final chapter in a
long record of events was not enacted until the early years of
the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>The roads in the neighbourhood of York on February 2, 1829,
were thronged with excited crowds hurrying to the city.&nbsp;
Dashing through them came the fire-engines of Leeds, and others
from Escrick Park.&nbsp; Far ahead, a great column of smoke
hovered in the cold February sky.&nbsp; York Minster was on
fire.</p>
<p>It was no accident that had caused this conflagration, but the
wild imaginings of one Jonathan Martin, which had prompted him to
become the incendiary of that stately pile.&nbsp; A singular
character, compacted of the unlovely characteristics of Mawworm
and the demented prophet, Solomon Eagle, this was the crowning
act of a life distinguished by religious mania.&nbsp; Jonathan
Martin was born at Hexham in 1782, and apprenticed to a
tanner.&nbsp; His parents were poor, and he had only the
slightest kind of education.&nbsp; At the expiration of his
apprenticeship he found himself in London, and was speedily
entrapped by the press-gang and sent to serve his Majesty as an
able <a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>seaman.&nbsp; It seems to have been at this period that
the unbalanced state of his mind first became noticeable.&nbsp;
He was with the fleet at many places, and often in action, from
Copenhagen to the Nile.&nbsp; At times he would exhibit
cowardice, and at others either indifference to danger or actual
bravery.&nbsp; He would be religious, dissolute, industrious,
idle, sulky, or cheerful by turns: a pretended dreamer of dreams
and communicant with angels.&nbsp; &ldquo;Parson Saxe,&rdquo; his
shipmates named him; &ldquo;but,&rdquo; said one, years
afterwards, &ldquo;I always thought him more rogue than
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin was paid off in 1810.&nbsp; He settled to work for a
farmer at Norton, near Durham, and shortly afterwards
married.&nbsp; He became a member of the Wesleyan Methodist body
at Norton, and began those religious exercises which he claims to
have converted him and to have emancipated him from the law,
being &ldquo;justified by faith&rdquo; only.&nbsp; How dangerous
such views of personal irresponsibility can be when held by the
weak-minded his after-career was only too plainly to show.&nbsp;
He immediately conceived an abhorrence of the Church of England,
as a church teaching obedience to pastors and masters, and of the
clergy for their worldliness.&nbsp; In this last respect, indeed,
Martin&mdash;as we think now&mdash;had no little justification,
for the Church had not then begun to arise from the almost Pagan
slough of laziness, indifference, and greed of wealth and good
living which throughout the previous century had marked the
members of the Establishment, from the country parson up to the
archbishops.&nbsp; When clergymen could find it in them to
perform the solemn rite of the burial service while in a state of
drunkenness; when, under Martin&rsquo;s own observation at
Durham, the Prince-Bishop of that city enjoyed emoluments and
perquisites amounting to &pound;30,000 per annum, there is little
cause for surprise that hatred and contempt of the cloth should
arise.</p>
<p>This basis of justification, acting upon a mind already
diseased, and not rendered more healthy by fasting and brooding
over the Scriptures, resulted in his attempting <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>to preach
from church pulpits, in writing threatening letters to the
clergy, and eventually to a silly threat to shoot the Bishop of
Oxford when at Stockport.&nbsp; For this he was rightly confined
in a lunatic asylum at Gateshead.&nbsp; Some months later he
managed to escape, and after wandering about the country took
service with his former employer at Norton, the magistrates
consenting to his remaining at liberty.&nbsp; In 1822 he left for
Darlington, where he lived until 1827.&nbsp; His wife had died
while he was in the asylum, and in 1828, while engaged in hawking
a pamphlet biography of himself at Boston, he made the
acquaintance of a young woman of that town and married her.&nbsp;
By this time his religious mania had grown worse, and when, on
December 26, 1828, he and his wife journeyed to York, it would
appear that he went there with the design of burning the
Cathedral already half-formed.&nbsp; He haunted the building day
by day, leaving denunciatory letters from time to time.&nbsp;
One, discovered on the iron grille of the choir screen, exhorted
the clergy to &ldquo;repent and cry For marcey for know is the
day of vangens and your Cumplet Destruction is at Hand for the
Lord will not sufer you and the Deveal and your blind Hellish
Docktren to dseve the works of His Hands no longer. . . .&nbsp;
Depart you Carsit blind Gides in to the Hotest plase of Hell to
be tormentid with the Deveal and all his Eanguls for Ever and
Ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Violent language! but one may hear harangues very like it any
day within Hyde Park, by the Marble Arch.&nbsp; There are many
incendiaries in the making around us to-day, and as little
attention is paid to them as to Martin&rsquo;s ravings.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly mad, he possessed something of the madman&rsquo;s
cunning, and with the plan of firing the Cathedral fully formed,
set out with his wife for Leeds, as he gave out, on the 27th of
January.&nbsp; At Leeds he remained a few days, and was
remarkable for his unusually quiet and orderly behaviour.&nbsp;
He left on Saturday morning, ostensibly for Tadcaster, saying he
should return on the Monday; but went instead to <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>York.&nbsp;
Here the madman&rsquo;s cunning broke down, for he stayed at a
place where he was well known; at the lodgings, in fact, that he
had left a few days before.&nbsp; He prowled about the Cathedral
the whole of the next day, Sunday, and attended service there,
hiding behind a tomb in the north transept; overheard the notes
of the organ&mdash;the finest in England&mdash;thundering and
booming and rolling in echoes amid the fretted roofs.&nbsp; The
sound troubled the brain of the maniac.&nbsp; &ldquo;Buzz,
buzz,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll teach thee to stop
thy buzzing,&rdquo; and hid, shivering with religious and lunatic
ecstasy, in the recess until the building was empty.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The short February day closed, and left the Cathedral in
darkness; but he still waited.&nbsp; The ringers paid their
evening-visit to the belfry, and he watched them from his
hiding-place.&nbsp; He watched them go and then began his
work.&nbsp; The ringers had left the belfry unlocked.&nbsp;
Ascending to it, he cut a length of about a hundred feet off the
prayer-bell rope, and, with his sailor&rsquo;s handiness, made a
rough ladder of it, by which to escape.&nbsp; Those were the days
before lucifer matches.&nbsp; He had come provided with a razor,
which he used as a steel; a flint, tinder, and a penny candle cut
in two.&nbsp; Climbing, then, into the choir, he made two piles
on the floor of prayer-books, curtains, hassocks, and cushions,
and taking a candle from the altar, cut it up and distributed it
between the two.&nbsp; Then, setting light to them, he set to
work to escape.&nbsp; He had taken a pair of pincers from the
shoemaker with whom he lodged, and breaking with them a window in
the north transept, he hauled his rope through, and descended
into the Minster Yard, soon after three o&rsquo;clock in the
morning.</p>
<p>The fire was not discovered until four hours later.&nbsp; By
that time the stalls were half-consumed, and the vestry, where
the communion plate was kept, was on fire.&nbsp; The plate was
melted into an unrecognisable mass.&nbsp; By eight o&rsquo;clock,
despite the exertions of many willing helpers, the organ-screen
was burnt, and the organ-pipes fell in thunder to the pavement,
to the <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>accompaniment of a furious shower of molten lead from
the roof, which was now burning.&nbsp; The city fire-engines,
those of the Cathedral, and others from Leeds and Escrick were
all playing upon the conflagration that day, and the 7th Dragoon
Guards and the Militia helped with a will, or kept back the vast
crowds which had poured into the city from far and near.&nbsp; It
was not until evening that the fire was quenched, and by that
time the roof of the choir, over 130 feet in length, had been
destroyed, and with it the stalls, the Bishop&rsquo;s throne, and
all the medi&aelig;val enrichments of that part of the
building.&nbsp; Curiously enough, the great east window was but
little damaged.&nbsp; The cost of this madman&rsquo;s act was put
at &pound;100,000.&nbsp; A singular coincidence, greatly remarked
upon at the time, was that on the Sunday following this disaster,
one of the lessons for the day was the sixty-fourth chapter of
Isaiah, the Church&rsquo;s prayer to God, of which one verse at
least was particularly applicable: &ldquo;Our holy and our
beautiful house, where our fathers praised Thee, is burned with
fire; and all our pleasant things are laid waste.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin was, in the first instance, connected with the outrage
by the evidence of the shoemaker&rsquo;s pincers he had left
behind him.&nbsp; They were identified by his landlord.&nbsp;
Meanwhile, the incendiary had fled along the Great North Road;
first to Easingwold, thirteen miles away, where he drank a pint
of ale; and then tramping on to Thirsk.&nbsp; Thence he hurried
to Northallerton, arriving at three o&rsquo;clock in the
afternoon, worn out with thirty-three miles of walking.&nbsp;
That night he journeyed in a coal-cart to West Auckland, and so
eventually to a friend near Hexham, in whose house he was
arrested on the 6th of February.&nbsp; Taken to York, he was
tried at the sessions at York Castle on March 30th.&nbsp; The
verdict, given on the following day, was &ldquo;not guilty, on
the ground of insanity,&rdquo; and he was ordered to be kept in
close custody during his Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure.&nbsp; Martin
was shortly afterwards removed from York Castle to St.
Luke&rsquo;s Hospital, <a name="page51"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 51</span>London, in which he died in
1838.&nbsp; Two years later, the Minster was again on fire, this
time as the result of an accident, and the western tower was
burnt out.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Insanity in some degree ran through the Martin family.&nbsp;
His brother John, who died in 1854, was a prominent artist, whose
unbalanced mind did not give way, but led him to paint
extraordinary pictures, chiefly of Scriptural interest and
apocalyptic horrors.&nbsp; He was in his day considered a genius,
and many of his terrific imaginations were engraved and must yet
be familiar: such pictures as &ldquo;Belshazzar&rsquo;s
Feast,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Eve of the Deluge,&rdquo; &ldquo;The
Last Man,&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Plains of Heaven&rdquo;: pictures
well calculated to give children nightmares.</p>
<h2>X</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> must now leave York for the
North.&nbsp; To do so, we proceed through Bootham Bar, where the
taxis linger that ply between the city and the railway
station.</p>
<p>Let us glance back upon the picturesque sky-line of City and
Minster and read, maybe, the modern explanatory historical
inscription placed on the ancient Bar.&nbsp; Thus:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Entry from North through Forest of
Galtres.&nbsp; In old times armed men were stationed here to
watch, and to conduct travellers through the forest and protect
them against the wolves.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Royal Arms were taken down in 1650, when Cromwell
passed through, against Scotland.&nbsp; Heads of three rebels
exposed here, for attempting to restore Commonwealth, 1663.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Erected on Roman foundation, probably early in 13th
centy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Interior rebuilt with freestone, 1719.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The portcullis remains.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So, in those ancient times when the Forest of Galtres lay
immediately before you on passing out of Bootham <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>Bar and going
North&mdash;the forest with wolves and bandits&mdash;you stepped
not into a suburb, but came directly off the threshold into the
wild.</p>

</a></p>
<p>To-day, outside the walls we come at once into the district of
Clifton, after Knavesmire the finest suburb of York; the wide
road lined with old mansions that almost reek of prebendal
appointments, J.P.&rsquo;s, incomes of over two thousand a year,
and butlers.&nbsp; It is true that there are those which cannot
be included in this category, but they are here on sufferance and
as a foil to the majesty of their superiors, just as the Lunatic
Asylum a little farther down the road gives, or should give, by
contrast a finer flavour to the lives of those who have not to
live in it.&nbsp; There is another pleasing thing at Clifton, in
the altogether charming new building of the &ldquo;White
Horse&rdquo; inn, which seems to hint that they have at last
begun to recover the lost art in Yorkshire of <a
name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 53</span>building
houses that are not vulgar or hideous.&nbsp; It is full time.</p>
<p>Would you see a charming village church, a jewel in its
sort?&nbsp; Then, when reaching Skelton, three miles onward,
explore the bye-road at the back of the village, over whose
clustered few roofs its Early English bell-cote peeps.&nbsp; But
a moment, please, before we reach it.&nbsp; This
&ldquo;bye-road&rdquo; is the original highway, and the
&ldquo;back&rdquo; of the village street its old front.&nbsp;
There is a moral application somewhere in these altered
circumstances for those who have the wit, the inclination, and
the opportunity to seek it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The improved road, a hundred years old, is carried straight
and level past the rear of the cottages, and the rugged old one
goes serpentining past the front doors, where the entrance to the
&ldquo;Bay Horse&rdquo; looks out across a little green to where
the church stands, the faded old Bay Horse himself wondering
where the traffic that use to pass this way has all gone
to.&nbsp; The signs of the &ldquo;Bay Horse&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Yorkshire Grey&rdquo; are, by the way, astonishingly
frequent on the Great North Road.</p>
<p><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>But the
church.&nbsp; It is an unpretending building, without a tower,
and only a bell-cote rising from its broad roof; but perfect
within its limits.&nbsp; Early English throughout, with
delicately-cut mouldings, beautiful triple lancets at the east
end, and fine porch, the green and grey harmonies of its slate
roof and well-preserved stonework, complete a rarely satisfying
picture.&nbsp; A legend, still current, says it was built from
stone remaining over after the building of the south transept of
York Cathedral, in 1227.&nbsp; The Church in the Wood it was
then, for from the gates of York to Easingwold, a distance of
thirteen miles, stretched that great Forest of Galtres, through
which, to guide wandering travellers, as we have already seen,
the lantern-tower and burning cresset of All Saints in the
Pavement, at York, were raised aloft.</p>
<p>Red deer roamed the Forest of Galtres, and bandits not so
chivalrous as Robin Hood; so few dared to explore its recesses
unarmed and unaccompanied.&nbsp; But where in olden times these
romantic attendants of, or dissuading circumstances from travel
existed, we have now only occasional trees and an infinity of
flat roads, past Shipton village to Tollerton Cross Lanes and
Easingwold.&nbsp; This country is dulness personified.&nbsp; The
main road is flat and featureless, and the branch roads instinct
with a melancholy emptiness that hives in every ditch and
commonplace hedgerow.&nbsp; A deadly sameness, a paralysing
negation, closes the horizon of this sparsely settled district,
depopulated in that visitation of fire and sword when William the
Conqueror came, in 1069, and massacred a hundred thousand of
those who had dared to withstand him.&nbsp; They had surrendered
on promise of their lives and property being respected, but the
fierce Norman utterly destroyed the city of York and laid waste
the whole of the country between York and Durham.&nbsp; Those who
were not slain perished miserably of cold and famine.&nbsp; Their
pale ghosts still haunt the route of the Great North Road and
afflict it, though more than eight hundred years have flown.</p>
<p><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>Now
comes Easingwold; grimly bare and gritty wide street, with narrow
pavements and broad selvedges of cobbles sloping from them down
into a roadway filled, not with traffic, but with children at
noisy play.&nbsp; Shabby houses lining this street, houses little
better than cottages, and ugly at that; grey, hard-featured,
forbidding.&nbsp; Imagine half a mile of this, with a large
church on a knoll away at the northern end, and you have
Easingwold.&nbsp; One house is interesting.&nbsp; It is easily
identified, because it is the only one of any architectural
character in the place.&nbsp; Now a school, it was once the chief
coaching and posting establishment, under the sign of the
&ldquo;Rose and Crown,&rdquo; and in those times kept five post
boys, and, by consequence, twenty horses, others being kept for
the &ldquo;Wellington&rdquo; and &ldquo;Express&rdquo; coaches
which Lacy, the landlord, used to horse on the Easingwold to
Thirsk stage.&nbsp; The &ldquo;New Inn,&rdquo; although an
inferior house, was the place at which the Royal mail and the
&ldquo;Highflyer&rdquo; changed.</p>
<p>An old post boy of the &ldquo;Rose and Crown&rdquo; survived
until recent years, in the person of Tommy Hutchinson.&nbsp;
Originally a tailor, he early forsook the board and the needle
for the pigskin and the whip.&nbsp; If a tailor be the ninth part
of a man, certainly the weazened postboys (who ever saw a fat
one?) of old were themselves only fractions, so far as appearance
went; and accordingly Tommy was not badly suited.&nbsp; But a
power of endurance was contained within that spare frame, and he
eclipsed John Blagg of Retford&rsquo;s hundred and ten
miles&rsquo; day on one occasion, riding post five times from
Easingwold to York and back, a distance of a hundred and thirty
miles.&nbsp; Tommy used to express an utter contempt for
&ldquo;bilers on wheels,&rdquo; as he called locomotives.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Ah divvent see nowt in &rsquo;em,&rdquo; he would say;
&ldquo;ye can&rsquo;t beat a po&rsquo;shay and good
horses.&rdquo;&nbsp; Peace be with him!</p>
<p>That rare thing on the Great North Road, a rise, leads out of
Easingwold, past unkempt cottages, to &ldquo;White House
Inn,&rdquo; a mile and a half distant, where the inn buildings,
now farmhouses, but still brilliantly <a name="page56"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 56</span>whitewashed, stand on either side of
the road, in a lonely spot near where the Kyle stream, like a
flowing ditch, oozes beneath Dawnay Bridge.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;White House&rdquo; was the scene of a murder in
1623.&nbsp; At that time the innkeeper was a certain Ralph
Raynard, who &ldquo;kept company&rdquo; with a girl in service at
Red House, Thornton Bridge.&nbsp; The lovers quarrelled, and in a
pique the girl married a farmer named Fletcher, of Moor House,
Raskelfe.&nbsp; Unhappily, she did not love the man she had
married, while she certainly did retain an affection for her old
sweetheart, and he for her.&nbsp; Going between Raskelfe and
Easingwold on market-days on her horse, she would often stop at
the &ldquo;White House,&rdquo; and chat with Ralph Raynard; the
ostler, Mark Dunn, minding the horse when she dismounted.&nbsp;
Raynard&rsquo;s sister kept house with him at the inn, and she
saw that no good could come of these visits, but he would not
listen to her warnings, and the visits continued.&nbsp; It was
not long before Fletcher&rsquo;s neighbours began to hint to him
something of these little flirtations of his wife with her old
lover; and one evening he caught the ostler of the &ldquo;White
House&rdquo; in his orchard, where he was waiting for an
opportunity to deliver a message from Raynard to her.&nbsp; The
man returned to the inn without having fulfilled his mission, and
smarting from a thrashing he had received at the hands of the
indignant farmer.&nbsp; Shortly after this, Fletcher had occasion
to go a journey.&nbsp; Things had not been going well with him
latterly, and his home was rendered unhappy by the evidence of
his wife&rsquo;s dislike of him.&nbsp; Little wonder, then, that
he had dismal forebodings as he set out.&nbsp; Before leaving, he
wrote on a sheet of paper:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>If I should be missing, or suddenly wanted be,<br
/>
Mark Ralph Raynard, Mark Dunn, and mark my wife for me,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>addressing it to his sister.</p>
<p>No sooner was he gone than Mrs. Fletcher mounted her horse and
rode to Raskelfe, where, with Raynard and Mark Dunn, a murderous
plot was contrived for <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>putting Fletcher out of the
way.&nbsp; They were waiting for him when he returned at evening,
and as he stood a moment on Dawnay Bridge, where the little river
runs beneath the highway, two of them rushed upon him and threw
him into the water.&nbsp; It would be difficult for a man to
drown here, but the innkeeper and the ostler leapt in after him,
and as he lay there held his head under water, while his wife
seized his feet.&nbsp; When the unfortunate man was quite dead
they thrust his body into a sack, and, carrying their burden with
them to the inn, buried it in the garden, Raynard sowing some
mustard-seed over the spot.&nbsp; This took place on the 1st of
May.&nbsp; On the 7th of July, Raynard went to Topcliffe Fair,
and put up at the &ldquo;Angel.&rdquo;&nbsp; Going into the
stable, he was confronted by the apparition of the unhappy
Fletcher, glowing with a strange light and predicting
retribution.&nbsp; He rushed out among the booths, and tried to
think he had been mistaken.&nbsp; Coming to a booth where they
sold small trinkets, he thought he would buy a present for his
sweetheart, and, taking up a chain of coral beads, asked the
stallkeeper how it looked on the neck.&nbsp; To his dismay the
apparition stood opposite, with a red chain round its neck, with
its head hanging to one side, like that of an executed criminal,
while a voice informed him that presently he and his accomplices
should be wearing hempen necklaces.</p>
<p>When night had fallen he mounted his horse and rode for
home.&nbsp; On the way, at a spot called the Carr, he saw
something in the road.&nbsp; It was a figure emerging from a sack
and shaking the water off it, like a Newfoundland dog.&nbsp; With
a yell of terror the haunted man dug his heels into his horse and
galloped madly away; but the figure, irradiated by a
phosphorescent glimmer and dragging an equally luminous sack
after it, was gliding in front of him all the while, at an equal
pace, and so continued until the &ldquo;White House&rdquo; was
reached, where it slid through the garden hedge and into the
ground where Fletcher&rsquo;s body had been laid.</p>
<p>Raynard&rsquo;s sister was waiting for him, with supper <a
name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 58</span>ready, and
with a dish of freshly-cut mustard.&nbsp; <i>She</i> did not see
the spectre sitting opposite, pointing a minatory finger at that
dreadful salad, but <i>he</i> did, and terrified, confessed to
the crime.&nbsp; Sisterly affection was not proof against this,
and she laid information against the three accomplices before a
neighbouring Justice of the Peace, Sir William Sheffield of
Raskelfe Park.&nbsp; They were committed to York Castle, tried,
and hanged on July 28, 1623.&nbsp; The bodies were afterwards cut
down and taken to the inn, being gibbeted near the scene of the
crime, on a spot still called Gallows Hill, where the bones of
the three malefactors were accidentally ploughed up over a
hundred and twenty years ago.</p>
<p>If its surroundings may be said to fit in with a crime, then
this seems an ideal spot for the commission of dark deeds, this
eerie place where an oozy plantation, or little wood, is placed
beside the road, its trees standing in pools or on moss-grown
tussocks; the road in either direction a solitude.</p>
<p>Raskelfe, or &ldquo;Rascall,&rdquo; as it is generally called,
lies away from the road.&nbsp; It has a church which still
possesses a wooden tower, and the local rhyme,</p>
<blockquote><p>Wooden church, wooden steeple,<br />
Rascally church, and rascally people.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>is yet heard in the mouths of depreciatory neighbours.</p>
<h2>XI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Hambleton Hills now come in
sight, and close in the view on the right hand, at a distance of
five miles; running parallel with the road as far as
Northallerton; sullen hills, with the outlines of mountains, and
wanting only altitude to earn the appellation.&nbsp; The road, in
sympathy with its nearness to them, goes up and down in jerky
rises and falls, passing the outlying houses of Thormanby and the
farmsteads of Birdforth, which pretends, with its mean little
church, <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>like a sanctified cow-shed, to be a village&mdash;and
signally fails.</p>
<p>The gates of Thirkleby Park and the &ldquo;Griffin&rdquo; inn,
standing where a toll-gate formerly stood on what was once Bagby
Common, bring one past a bye-road which leads to Coxwold, five
miles away, and to the Hambleton White Horse, a quite
unhistorical imitation, cut in the hillside in 1857, of its
prehistoric forerunners in Berkshire and Wilts.&nbsp; Coxwold is
a rarely pretty village, famous as having been the living of the
Reverend Laurence Sterne from 1760 to 1768.&nbsp; The house he
lived in, now divided into three cottages, is the place where
<i>Tristram Shandy</i> was finished and the <i>Sentimental
Journey</i> written.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shandy Hall&rdquo; it is
called, &ldquo;shandy&rdquo; being the local dialect-word for
&ldquo;crazy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thirsk lies less than three miles ahead.&nbsp; There have been
those who have called it &ldquo;picturesque.&rdquo;&nbsp; Let us
pity them, for those to whom Thirsk shows a picturesque side must
needs have acquaintance with only the sorriest and most
commonplace of towns.&nbsp; The place is, in fact, a larger
Easingwold, with the addition of a market-place like that of
Selby&mdash;after the abbey has been subtracted from it!&nbsp;
There are Old Thirsk and New Thirsk, the new town called into
existence by the railway, a mile to the west.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Three Tuns,&rdquo; &ldquo;Crown,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Fleece&rdquo; were the three coaching inns of Thirsk, and
still show their hard-featured faces to the grey, gaunt
streets.&nbsp; The one pretty &ldquo;bit&rdquo; is encountered
after having left the town behind.&nbsp; Passing the church, the
road is bordered by the beautiful broad sheet of water formed by
damming the Caldbeck.&nbsp; Looking backwards, the view is
charming, with the church-tower coming into the composition, a
glance to the left including the Hambleton Hills.</p>
<p>The hamlet of Thornton-le-Street, which derives its name from
standing on an old Roman road, is a tiny place with a small
church full of large monuments, and the remains of a huge old
posting establishment, once familiar to travellers as the
&ldquo;Spotted Dog,&rdquo; <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>standing on either side of the
road.&nbsp; One side appears to be empty, and the other is now
the post office.&nbsp; A graceful clump of poplars now shades the
sharp bend where the road descends, past the lodge-gates of the
Hall, the seat of the Earl of Cathcart.&nbsp; Presently the road
climbs again to the crest whence Thornton-le-Moor may be glimpsed
on the left, and thence goes, leaving the singularly named
Thornton-le-Beans on the right, in commonplace fashion to
Northallerton.</p>

<p>As are Easingwold and Thirsk, so is Northallerton.&nbsp; Let
that suffice for its aspect, and let us to something of its
story, which practically begins in 1138, at the battle of
Northallerton, dimly read of in schooldays, and still capable of
conferring an interest upon the <a name="page61"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 61</span>locality, even though the site of
that old-time struggle on Standard Hill is three miles away to
the north on Cowton Moor.&nbsp; The position of the townlet,
directly in the line of march of Scots descending to harry the
English, and of the English marching to punish those hairy-legged
Caledonians, led to many plunderings and burnings, and to various
scenes of retribution, enacted in the streets or along the road;
and although Northallerton must nowadays confess to a mile-long
dulness, time cannot have hung heavily with its inhabitants when
the Scots burnt their houses in 1319 and again in 1322; when the
rebel Earls of 1569 were executed near the church; when the
Scottish army held Charles the First prisoner here in 1647, or
when&mdash;last scene in its story&mdash;the Duke of Cumberland
encamped on the hillsides in 1745.</p>
<p>The name of Allerton is said to derive from the Anglo-Saxon
<i>aelr</i>, an alder tree, and many are the Allertons of sorts
in Yorkshire.&nbsp; Its central feature&mdash;which, however, is
not geographically central, but at the northern end of the one
long street&mdash;is the church, large and with a certain air of
nobility which befits the parish church of such a place as
Northallerton, anciently the capital of a &ldquo;soke,&rdquo; and
still giving a name to the &ldquo;Northallertonshire&rdquo;
district of Yorkshire.&nbsp; The old coaching inns of the town,
like those of so many other northern towns and villages on this
road, are not impressive to the Southerner, who, the further
north he progresses, is, with Dr. Johnson, still more firmly
convinced that he is leaving the finest fruits of civilisation
behind him.&nbsp; First now, as then, is the &ldquo;Golden
Lion,&rdquo; large but not lovely; the inn referred to as the
&ldquo;Black Swan&rdquo; by Sydney Smith when writing to Lady
Grey, advising her how to journey from London, in the passage,
&ldquo;Do not set off too soon, or you will be laid up at the
&lsquo;Black Swan,&rsquo; Northallerton, or the &lsquo;Elephant
and Castle,&rsquo; Boroughbridge; and your bill will come to a
thousand pounds, besides the waiter.&rdquo;&nbsp; The true
sportsman who reads these lines will put up at the &ldquo;Golden
Lion&rdquo; to test <a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>whether or not the reverend humorist is out of date as
regards the tariff; nor will he forget to try the Northallerton
ale, to determine if Master George Meryon&rsquo;s verse, written
in the days of James the Second, is still topical:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Northallerton, in Yorkshire, doth excel!<br />
All England, nay, all Europe, for strong yell.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The &ldquo;Golden Lion&rdquo; was, at the close of the
coaching era, the foremost inn at Northallerton, and at its doors
the &ldquo;Wellington&rdquo; London and Newcastle coach changed
teams until the railway ran it off the road.&nbsp; The Edinburgh
mail changed at the &ldquo;Black Bull,&rdquo; which survives as
an inn, but only half its original size, the other half now being
a draper&rsquo;s shop.&nbsp; The &ldquo;King&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo;
another coaching-house, has quite retired into private life,
while the &ldquo;Old Golden Lion,&rdquo; not a very noted
coaching establishment, except, perhaps, for the bye-roads,
remains much the same as ever.</p>
<h2>XII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Northallerton we reach the
junction of the alternative route, which, branching from the
Selby and York itinerary, goes over difficult, but much more
beautiful, country by way of Wetherby and Boroughbridge.&nbsp;
The ways diverge at the northern extremity of Doncaster, and as
both can equally claim to be an integral part of the Great North
Road, it is necessary to go back these sixty-three miles to that
town and explore the route.&nbsp; Beginning at a left-hand fork
by the flat meadows that border the river Don, it comes in a mile
to York Bar, a name recalling the existence of a turnpike-gate,
whose disappearance so recently as 1879 seems to bring us
strangely near old coaching days.&nbsp; The toll-house still
stands, and with the little inn beyond, backed and surrounded by
tall trees, forms a pleasant peep down the long <a
name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 63</span>flat
road.&nbsp; &ldquo;Red House,&rdquo; nearly three miles onward,
is plainly indicated by its flaring red-painted walls.&nbsp; Now
a farmhouse, it was once a small coaching-inn principally
concerned with the traffic along the Wakefield road, which
branches off here to the left.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Passing this, we come in two miles to Robin Hood&rsquo;s Well,
a group of houses by Skelbrooke Park, where at the &ldquo;New
Inn&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Robin Hood&rdquo; many coaches changed
horses daily, the passengers taking the opportunity of drinking
from Robin Hood&rsquo;s Well, a spring connected with that
probably mythical outlaw, who is said to have met the Bishop of
Hereford travelling along the road at this spot, and to have not
only held him to heavy ransom, but to have compelled him to dance
an undignified jig round an oak in Skelbrooke Park, on a spot
still called (now the tree itself has disappeared)
&ldquo;Bishop&rsquo;s Tree Root.&rdquo;&nbsp; Among famous <a
name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 64</span>travellers
who have sipped of the crystal spring of Robin Hood&rsquo;s Well
is Evelyn, who journeyed this way in 1654.&nbsp; &ldquo;Near
it,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;is a stone chaire; and an iron ladle
to drink out of, chained to the seat.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p64.jpg">
<img alt=

title=
"Robin Hood&rsquo;s Well"
 src="images/p64.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>Some fifty years later, the very ugly building that now covers
the spring was erected by Vanbrugh for the Earl of
Carlisle.&nbsp; It cannot be said to add much to the romantic
associations of the place, but the efforts of the wayfarers, who
in two centuries have carved every available inch of its surface
with their names, render it a curious sight.</p>
<p>Here the road begins a long climb up to the spot where five
ways meet, the broad left-hand road conducting into Leeds.&nbsp;
This is, or was, Barnsdale Bar, where some of the local Leeds
coaches branched from the Great North Road, the chief ones
between London and Leeds continuing along this route as far as
Peckfield Turnpike, five miles to the other side of
Ferrybridge.&nbsp; Barnsdale Bar is, like all the other
toll-bars, a thing of the past, but the old toll-house <a
name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>still hides
among the trees by the roadside.&nbsp; Beyond it the way lies
along an exposed road high up on the hill-tops; a lonely stretch
of country where it is a peculiarly ill mischance to be caught in
a storm.&nbsp; Thence it plunges suddenly into the deep gorge of
Went Bridge, where the little river Went goes with infantile fury
among rocks and mossy boulders along a winding course thickly
overhung with trees.&nbsp; The wooded sides of this narrow valley
are picturesque in the highest degree, but were probably not
highly appreciated by timid coach-passengers who, having been
driven down the precipitous road at one side at the peril of
their lives, were turned out by the guard to ease the toiling
horses by walking up the corresponding ascent at the other.&nbsp;
This is the prettiest spot in all &ldquo;merry Barnsdale,&rdquo;
and anciently one of those most affected by Robin Hood.&nbsp; His
very degenerate successors, the poachers and cut-throats of James
the First&rsquo;s time, found it a welcome harbourage and
foregathered at the predecessor of the Old Blue Bell Inn, which
was accordingly deprived of its license for some time.&nbsp; The
old sign, bearing the date of 1633, when business was probably
resumed, is still kept within the house, as the rhymed
inscription on the modern one outside informs the
passer-by:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Blae Bell on Wentbridge Hill,<br />
The old sign is existing still<br />
Inside the house.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>An old posting-inn, the &ldquo;Bay Horse,&rdquo; has long
since reverted to the condition of a private house.</p>
<p>The road rising out of Went Bridge runs between the jagged
rocks of a cutting made in the last years of the coaching age to
lighten the pull up, but still it is a formidable climb.&nbsp;
This is followed by a hollow where a few outlying houses of
Darrington village are seen, and then the bleak high tableland is
reached that has to be traversed before the road drops down into
the valley of the Aire at Ferrybridge, that now dull and grimy
town which bears no appearance of <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>having had an historic past.&nbsp;
Yet Ferrybridge was the scene of the skirmish that heralded the
battle of Towton, and stands in the midst of that medi&aelig;val
cockpit of England, wherein for centuries so many rival factions
contended together.&nbsp; Near by is Pontefract, in whose castle
Richard the Second met a mysterious death, and not far off lies
Wakefield.&nbsp; Towton Field itself lies along the Tadcaster
route to York.&nbsp; In every direction blood has been shed, for
White Rose or Red, for King or Parliament; but Ferrybridge is
anything but romantic to the eye, however greatly its
associations may appeal to the well-stored mind.&nbsp;
Coal-mining and quarrying industries overlie these things.&nbsp;
The place-name explains the situation of the townlet sufficiently
well, and refers to the first building of a bridge over the
old-time ferry by which wayfarers crossed the Aire to Brotherton,
on the opposite bank.&nbsp; It is quite unknown when the first
bridge was built, but one existed here in 1461, the year when
Towton fight was fought.&nbsp; This was succeeded by a wooden
structure, itself replaced by the present substantial stone
bridge, built at the beginning of the eighteenth century.&nbsp;
This was always a troublesome part of the road to keep in repair,
as we may judge from old records.&nbsp; A forty days&rsquo;
indulgence was granted by the Bishop of Durham early in the
fourteenth century to the faithful who would contribute to the
repair of the road between Ferrybridge and Brotherton, in these
words:&mdash;&ldquo;Persuaded that the minds of the faithful are
more ready to attach themselves to pious works when they have
received the salutary encouragement of fuller indulgences,
trusting in the mercy of God Almighty and the merits and prayers
of the glorious Virgin his Mother, of St. Peter, St. Paul, and of
the most holy confessor Cuthbert, our patron, and of all saints,
we remit forty days of the penances imposed on all our
parishioners and others, sincerely contrite and confessed of
their sins, who shall help by their charitable gifts, or by their
bodily labour, in the building or in the maintenance of the
causeway <a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>between Brotherton and Ferrybridge, where a great many
people pass by.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Let us hope that the pious, thus incited to the commission of
good works, responded.&nbsp; It was a more serious matter,
however, in later ages, when a great many more people passed by,
and when road-surveyors, unable to dispense these ghostly
favours, repaired the roads only at the pecuniary expense of the
ratepayers.&nbsp; These Yorkshire streams, the Aire, the Wharfe,
and many others, descending from the high moorlands, develop an
extraordinary force in times of flood, and have often destroyed
half the communications of these districts.&nbsp; Such was the
havoc wrought in 1795 that many of the bridges were washed away
and great holes made in the roads.&nbsp; Three bridges on this
road between Doncaster and Ferrybridge disappeared.&nbsp; With
such perils threatened, travellers deserved to be comfortably
housed when they lay by for the night.&nbsp; And comfort was the
especial feature of these inns.</p>
<p>The most luxurious inn and posting-house in the north of
England was held to be the &ldquo;Swan&rdquo; at Ferrybridge;
&ldquo;in 1737 and since the best inn upon the great northern
road,&rdquo; according to Scott.&nbsp; However that may have
been, certainly the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; at Ferry-bridge was the
largest.&nbsp; Both, however, have long since been given
up.&nbsp; The many scattered buildings of the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo;
have become private houses, and the &ldquo;Swan,&rdquo; empty for
many years past, is falling into a roofless ruin by the
riverside.&nbsp; Innkeeping was no mean trade in those times,
especially when allied with the proprietorship of horses and
coaches.&nbsp; Thus, in the flower of the coaching age, the
&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; was in the hands of a medical man, a certain
Dr. Alderson, the son of a local clergyman, who actually found
time to attend properly to his practice and to conduct the
business of a licensed victualler and coach-proprietor.&nbsp; He
thought it not derogatory to his social position to be
&ldquo;mine host,&rdquo; and he certainly made many friends by
his enterprise.&nbsp; Ferrybridge, as the branching-off <a
name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 68</span>place of yet
another Great North Road route&mdash;the Tadcaster route to
York&mdash;was a very busy coaching centre, and besides the two
inns mentioned there were the &ldquo;Greyhound&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Golden Lion.&rdquo;&nbsp; The last-named was especially
the drovers&rsquo; house.&nbsp; Drovers were a great feature of
the road in these old days, and their flocks and herds an
unmitigated nuisance to all other travellers.&nbsp; Uncouth
creatures from Scotland, they footed it all the way to London
with their beasts, making their twenty miles a day; their sheep
and cattle often numerous enough to occupy a whole mile of road,
and raising dust-clouds dense enough to choke a whole
district.&nbsp; It was, at the pace they went, a three
weeks&rsquo; journey from the far north to London and the fat
cattle that started on the four hundred miles walk must, with
these efforts, have become the leanest of kine on arrival at
Smithfield.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Old Fox&rdquo; inn, which still stands on the other
side of the river at Brotherton, was also a drovers&rsquo; place
of call.&nbsp; It stands at the actual fork of the roads, eleven
miles from Tadcaster, and twenty from York.&nbsp; The Edinburgh
mail originally ran this way, finally changing to the Selby
route, while the &ldquo;Highflyer&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Wellington,&rdquo; London and Edinburgh and London and
Newcastle, coaches kept on it until the end in 1840; but it was
chiefly crowded with the cross-country coach traffic, which was a
very heavy one.</p>
<p>The places are few and uninteresting on these twenty miles
into York; Sherburn and Tadcaster&mdash;that town of
ales&mdash;the chief of them; while the tiny godless village of
Towton, without a church, on the way, is disappointing to the
pilgrim, eager to see it for the sake of its association with the
great battle.&nbsp; The road skirts the eastern side of that
tragic field, after passing the hamlet of Barkston Ash.</p>
<h2><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>XIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> battle of Towton, March 29,
1461, was the bloodiest ever fought on English ground, the slain
on both sides in that desperate fight and in the skirmishes at
Ferrybridge and Dintingdale amounting to more than 30,000
men.&nbsp; The events that had preceded it were alternately
cheering and depressing to the hopes of the Yorkists, who had
been defeated with great slaughter at Wakefield on the last day
but one of the previous December, had gained the important
victory of Mortimer&rsquo;s Cross on the 2nd of February, and had
been defeated again at the second battle of St. Albans on the
17th of the same month; and although on March 4th the young Duke
of York had entered London and assumed the crown as Edward the
Fourth, the Lancastrians still held the Midlands and, lying at
York, interposed a bold front against an advance.&nbsp; It was a
singular position.&nbsp; The Lancastrians had their headquarters
at the city from which their opponents took their title, and two
kings of England, equally matched in power, animated their
respective adherents with the utmost loyalty.</p>
<p>After their victory at St. Albans the Lancastrians, exhausted,
had retired to York, the south being as dangerous to a
Lancastrian army as the north, loyal to the Red Rose, was to the
Yorkists.&nbsp; The Yorkists, on their part, eager to enter
London, did not pursue their rivals.&nbsp; Both sides required
breathing time, for events had marched too rapidly in the past
two months for the pace to be maintained.&nbsp; Still, the
Yorkists were in force, three weeks later, at Pontefract, and
threatening to cross the Aire at Ferrybridge, a strategic point
on their contemplated line of advance to the city of York.&nbsp;
It was here, early in the morning of the 28th, that the bloody
prelude to the battle opened, in a sudden Lancastrian attack on
the Yorkist outpost.&nbsp; Lord Fitzwalter, the Yorkist
commander, lay asleep in bed at <a name="page70"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 70</span>the time.&nbsp; Seizing a pole-axe at
his sudden awakening, he was slain almost instantly, but his
force, succeeding in driving the enemy across the river, took up
a position at Brotherton, the Lancastrians falling back in
disorder to Dintingdale, near Barkston Ash, where, later in the
day, the Lancastrian, Lord Clifford, was slain by an arrow.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The advance-guard of the Lancastrian army now fell back upon
the main body, which took up a well-chosen position between the
villages of Saxton and Towton, lying across a rising road which
led out of the former place, and having on its right the steeply
falling meadows leading down into the deep depression of <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>Towton Dale,
where the Cock Beck still wanders in far-flung loops in the flat
lands below.&nbsp; On their left the ground stretched away for
some distance and then fell gently towards the flats of Church
Fenton.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p71.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>At their rear the road descended steeply again into Towton,
while Tadcaster lay three miles and York eleven miles
beyond.&nbsp; It was a position of great strength and one that
could only possibly be turned from the left.&nbsp; The fatal
defect of it lay in the chance, in the case of defeat, of the
beaten army being disorganised by a retreat down so steep a road,
leading as it did to the crossing of a stream swollen with winter
rains.</p>
<p>In visiting this spot, we must bear in mind that the broad
road from Ferrybridge to Tadcaster and York was not then in
existence.&nbsp; The way lay across the elevated land which,
rising from Barkston Ash towards Saxton, reaches to a
considerable height between that village and Towton.&nbsp; From
this commanding spot the valleys of the Wharfe and Ouse lie
plainly unfolded, <a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>and the towers of York itself may be seen on the
skyline, on the verge of this wide expanse of meadows and
woodlands.</p>
<p>The hedgerows on the way to the battle-field are remarkable
for the profusion of briar roses that grow here in place of the
more usual blackberry brambles and thorns, and Bloody Meadow, the
spot where the thickest of the fight took place, was until quite
recently thickly overgrown with the red and white roses with
which Nature had from time immemorial planted this scene of
strife.&nbsp; Latterly they have all been grubbed up by farmers,
keener on the purity of their grasslands than on historic
associations.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The main body of the Yorkists, advancing to Saxton, opened the
attack on the Lancastrians early in the morning of Palm Sunday,
the 29th.&nbsp; The centre of the fight was in the meadow on the
left hand of the road leading towards Towton, a short distance
beyond Towton Dale quarry.&nbsp; The Lancastrians numbered 60,000
men, the Yorkists 48,600.&nbsp; For ten hours the furious
encounter raged, &ldquo;sore fought, for hope of life <a
name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>was set aside
on every part.&rdquo;&nbsp; Six years&rsquo; warfare, from 1455,
when the first battle of St. Albans had been fought, had rendered
the enemies implacable.&nbsp; Almost every combatant had already
lost kinsfolk, and intense hatred caused the order on both sides
that no quarter was to be given and no prisoners taken.&nbsp; The
day was bitterly cold, and snowstorms swept the upland, driving
in the faces of the Lancastrians with such blinding fury that
their arrows, shot in reply to the Yorkist volleys, could not be
properly aimed, and so missed their mark.&nbsp; A hand-to-hand
encounter with swords and battle-axes then followed, obstinately
fought, but resulting practically in the butchery of the
Lancastrians, for nearly the half of their whole force were slain
or met their death either in Towton Dale or at the crossing of
the stream down the road past Towton Hall.&nbsp; The rest fled to
Tadcaster and on to York, where Henry the Sixth, the Queen, and
the young Prince of Wales were waiting the result of the
fight.&nbsp; They left immediately, and the victorious Duke of
York entered the ancient city.</p>
<p>Many proud nobles fell that day with the men-at-arms; among
others, Lord Dacre, fighting for the Red Rose, shot by a boy
concealed in what the country people call a
&ldquo;bur-tree,&rdquo; that is to say, an elder.&nbsp; He lies
buried in the churchyard of Saxton, on the north side of the
church, under a much-mutilated altar-tomb, whose inscription
refers to him as &ldquo;verus miles&rdquo;&mdash;a true
knight.&nbsp; Tradition yet tells of his death, in the local
rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>The Lord of Dacres<br />
Was slain in the North Acres,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>fields still known by that name.&nbsp; Many grave mounds
remain in Bloody Meadow, where a rude cross leans, half hidden
under a tangled hedge; and in 1848, during some excavations in
Saxton churchyard, a stratum of bones, four feet in thickness,
was exposed, the poor relics of those who fell in the great
fight.&nbsp; Others still are said to have been buried in the
little <a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>chapel of Lead, a mile away, by the banks of the Cock,
whose stream ran red that day.&nbsp; A few stones at the back of
Towton Hall mark the place where a votive chapel was erected,
where prayers might be said for the souls of the dead, whose
numbers on both sides are said by one authority to have reached
36,776.</p>

<p>Relics have been found on the battle-field.&nbsp; Many years
ago a wandering antiquary found a farmer&rsquo;s wife breaking
sugar with a battle-axe discovered in the river.&nbsp; She did
not know what it was, but he did, and secured it.&nbsp; It is now
at Alnwick Castle.&nbsp; In 1785 was found a gold ring which had
belonged to the Earl of Northumberland, who was carried mortally
wounded from the field.&nbsp; It weighs an ounce, and bears the
Percy Lion, with inscription, &ldquo;Now ys thus.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Another interesting and pathetic find was a spur, engraved with
&ldquo;En loial amour, tout mon coer,&rdquo; the relic of some
unknown knight.</p>

name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>valley, in an
almost sheer drop from the road, looking out upon illimitable
perspectives.&nbsp; Then comes Fairburn, followed by what used to
be Peckfield Turnpike, where the &ldquo;Boot and Shoe&rdquo; inn
stands at the fork of the roads, and where the Leeds and London
&ldquo;Royal Mail,&rdquo; &ldquo;Rockingham,&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Union Post&rdquo; coaches turned off.&nbsp; Micklefield,
two miles beyond, approached by a fine avenue of elms, is an
abject coal-mining village, and hauling-gear, smoke, and the inky
blackness of the roads emphasise the fact, even if the marshalled
coal-wagons on the railway did not give it insistence.&nbsp;
Coming up the craggy rise out of Micklefield and its coal, on to
Hook Moor, one of the finest stretches of the road,
<i>qu&acirc;</i> road, brings the traveller past the lodge-gates
of Parlington Park and the oddly ecclesiastical-looking
almshouses beyond, down into the stony old village of Aberford,
which lies in a depression on the Cock Beck.&nbsp; Beyond the
village, on journeying towards it, one sees the long straight
white road ascending the bastioned heights of windy Bramham Moor;
and the sight clinches any half-formed inclination to rest awhile
at Aberford before climbing to that airy eminence.</p>
<p>Aberford still seems to be missing its old posting and
coaching traffic, and to be awaiting the return of the days when
the Carlisle and Glasgow mail changed at the &ldquo;Swan,&rdquo;
a fine old inn, now much shrunken from its original state.&nbsp;
Stone-quarrying and the neighbouring coal-mines keep the village
from absolutely decaying; but it still lives in the past.&nbsp;
The picturesque old settles and yawning fireplaces of the
&ldquo;Swan,&rdquo; and of that oddly-named inn, the
&ldquo;Arabian Horse,&rdquo; eloquent of the habits of
generations ago, survive to show us what was the accommodation
those old inns provided.&nbsp; If more primitive, it was
heartier, and a great deal more comfortable than that of modern
hotels.</p>
<p>By the churchyard wall stands part of the old Market Cross,
discovered by the roadside and set up here in 1911; with the
&ldquo;Plague Stone&rdquo; in whose water-filled hollow
purchasers placed their money, so that the sellers might not risk
infection.</p>
<p><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 76</span>A
ruined windmill of strange design, perched on the hillside road
behind the village, is the best point whence to gain an idea of
the country in midst of which Aberford is set.&nbsp; It is boldly
undulating country, hiding in the folds of its hills many
old-world villages.&nbsp; Chief among them, two miles off the
road, is Barwick-in-Elmete&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> in the elm
country&mdash;with its prehistoric mounds and the modern
successor of an ancient maypole, set up in the village street by
the cross, presented in May 1898 by Major-General Gascoigne, of
Parlington Park.</p>

<p>The road two miles out of Aberford reaches that home of
howling winds, that most uncomfortable and undesirable place,
Bramham Moor.&nbsp; Here, where the Bramham Moor inn stands at
the crossing of the Leeds and York road, a considerable traffic
enlivened the way until eighty years ago.&nbsp; Since that time
the broad roadways in either direction have been empty, except
when the hounds meet here in the hunting season, when, for a
brief hour, old times seem come again.&nbsp; It was along this
cross-road that &ldquo;Nimrod,&rdquo; <a name="page77"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 77</span>that classic coaching authority,
travelled in 1827, his eagle eye engaged in criticism of the
Yorkshire provincial coaches.</p>

</a></p>
<p>The rustical driver of the Leeds to York stage, happily, did
not know who his passenger was.&nbsp; Let us hope he never saw
the criticism of himself, his coach and horses, and everything
that was his, which appeared shortly afterwards in the
<i>Sporting Magazine</i>.&nbsp; Everything, says
&ldquo;Nimrod,&rdquo; was inferior.&nbsp; The man who drove (he
scorns, you see, to call him a coachman) was <a
name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 78</span>more like a
Welsh drover than anything else.&nbsp; The day was cold, but he
had neither gloves, boots, nor gaiters.&nbsp; However, he
conducted the coach only a ten miles&rsquo; stage, and made up
with copious libations of gin for the lack of warm
clothing.&nbsp; On the way he fell to bragging with his box-seat
passenger of the hair&rsquo;s-breadth escapes he had experienced
when driving one of the Leeds to London opposition coaches; and
&ldquo;Nimrod,&rdquo; complimenting him on the skill he must have
shown on those occasions, he proceeded to give a taste of his
quality, which resulted in his getting the reins clubbed and a
narrow escape from being overturned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nimrod&rdquo;
soon had enough of it, and at the first opportunity pretended to
be ill and went inside, as being the least dangerous place.&nbsp;
Arriving at Tadcaster, ten miles from York, the door was opened,
and &ldquo;Please to remember the coachman&rdquo; tingled in the
ears of the passengers.&nbsp; &ldquo;What now,&rdquo; asked
&ldquo;Nimrod,&rdquo; &ldquo;are you going no
farther?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir, but ah&rsquo;s goes back at
night,&rdquo; was the Yorkshireman&rsquo;s answer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then you follow some trade here, of course?&rdquo;
continued the great coaching expert.&nbsp; &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo;
said a bystander, &ldquo;<i>he has got his horses to
clean</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fancy a coachman, even if only of that
inferior kind, who could not be called anything better than
&ldquo;the man who drove,&rdquo;&mdash;fancy a coachman seeing to
his own horses.&nbsp; &ldquo;Nimrod&rdquo; was properly shocked
at this, and with memories of coaching nearer London, with
stables and yards full of ostlers and helpers, and the coachmen,
their drinking done, flirting with the Hebes of the bar, could
only say, with a gasp, &ldquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s the way your
Yorkshire coaching is done, is it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He then saw his fellow-passengers pull out sixpence each and
give it to the driver, who was not only satisfied, but
thankful.&nbsp; This also was a novelty.&nbsp; Coachmen were, in
his experience, tipped with florins and half-crowns, nor even
then did they exhibit symptoms of thankfulness, but took the coin
as of right.&nbsp; &ldquo;What am I to do?&rdquo;
&ldquo;Nimrod&rdquo; asked himself; &ldquo;I never gave a
coachman sixpence yet, and <a name="page79"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 79</span>I shall not begin that game
to-day.&rdquo;&nbsp; So he &ldquo;chucked&rdquo; him a
&ldquo;bob,&rdquo; which brought the fellow&rsquo;s hat down to
the box of the fore-wheel in gratitude.</p>
<p>With a fresh team and another driver the journey was continued
to York.&nbsp; About half-way, the coach stopped at a
public-house, in the old style; the driver got down, the gin
bottle was produced, and, looking out of the window,
&ldquo;Nimrod&rdquo; was surprised to see the man whom he had
thought was left behind at Tadcaster.&nbsp; &ldquo;What, are you
here?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; answered the
man; &ldquo;&rsquo;tis market-day at York, and ah&rsquo;s wants
to buy a goose or two.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; observed
&ldquo;Nimrod,&rdquo; &ldquo;I thought you were a little in the
huckstering line.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XV</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Bramham Moor</span> leads down into
Bramham village, past the Park, where a ruined manor-house,
destroyed by fire, stands amid formal gardens and looks
tragical.&nbsp; The place wears the aspect of romance, and seems
an ideal home for the ideal Wicked Squire of Early Victorian
novels.&nbsp; Lord Bingley, who built it and laid out the grounds
in the time of Queen Anne, was not more wicked than the
generality of his contemporaries, but here are all the
&ldquo;properties&rdquo; with which those novelists surrounded
the cynical deceivers of innocence, who stalked in inky cloaks,
curly hats, and tasselled riding-boots through their gory
pages.&nbsp; Here is Lord Bingley&rsquo;s Walk, an avenue of
gigantic beeches where he did not meet the trustful village
maiden, as he ought to have done, by all the rules; here also is
the obelisk at the suggestively named Blackfen, whence twelve
avenues diverge&mdash;where no tattered witch ever cursed him, so
far as can be ascertained.&nbsp; Lord Bingley evidently did not
live up to the possibilities of the place, or of his station, nor
did those who came after him, for no horrid legend is narrated
with bated breath in Bramham village, which lies huddled together
in the <a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>hollow below the park, the world forgetting, and by the
world forgot, ever since that leap year, 1408, when on the 29th
of February the Earl of Northumberland, rebelling against Henry
the Fourth, was defeated and slain by Sir Thomas Rokeby at the
battle of Bramham Moor.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Rising steeply out of Bramham and coming to the crest at Moor
End, where the road descends long and continuously to Wetherby
and the river Wharfe, we come to what used to be regarded as the
half-way town between London and Edinburgh.&nbsp; The exact spot,
where a milestone told the same tale on either face, is, in fact,
one mile north, where the &ldquo;Old Fox&rdquo; inn stands.&nbsp;
This was, of course, the most noted landmark on the long road,
and the drovers who journeyed past it never failed to look in at
the &ldquo;Old Fox&rdquo; and &ldquo;wet their whistles,&rdquo;
to celebrate the completion of half their task.&nbsp; At Wetherby
itself the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; arrogated the title of
&ldquo;half-way house,&rdquo; and was the principal coaching
inn.&nbsp; It still stands, like its rival, the &ldquo;Swan <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>and
Talbot,&rdquo; smaller than of yore, the larger portion of its
stables now converted into cottages.&nbsp; At the
&ldquo;Angel&rdquo; the down London and Glasgow mail dined, with
an hour to spare; the up coach hurrying through to its change at
Aberford.&nbsp; Wetherby was a change for the stage-coaches,
which ran the whole seventeen miles to Ferrybridge with the same
teams; a cruelly long and arduous stretch for the horses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image81" href="images/p81.jpg">
<img alt=
"Nineveh"
title=
"Nineveh"
 src="images/p81.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>This is a hard-featured, stony town; still, as of old, chiefly
concerned with cattle-raising and cattle-dealing, and crowded on
market-days with farmers and drovers driving bargains or swearing
at the terrified efforts of beasts and sheep to find their way
into the shops and inns.&nbsp; Down on the southern side of the
town runs the romantic Wharfe, between rocky banks, hurrying in
swirling eddies towards its confluence with the Ouse, below
Tadcaster; and on to the north goes the road, through the main
street, on past the conspicuous spire of Kirk Deighton church,
coming in three miles to Walshford, where a bridge crosses the
rocky, tree-embowered Nidd, and that old posting-house, the
comfortable-looking &ldquo;Walshford Bridge Inn,&rdquo; stands
slightly back from the road, looking like a private mansion gone
diffidently into business.</p>
<p>Beyond Walshford Bridge the road turns suddenly to the left,
and, crossing the railway at lonely Allerton station, passes a
substantial red-brick farmhouse which looks as if it has seen
very different days.&nbsp; And indeed it has, for this was once
the &ldquo;New Inn,&rdquo; a changing-place for the mails.&nbsp;
Now on the right comes the long wall of Allerton Park, and
presently there rises ahead that strange mound known by the
equally strange name of Nineveh, a tree-crowned hill, partly
artificial, girdled with prehistoric earthworks, and honeycombed
with the graves of the forgotten tribes, to whom it was probably
at once a castle, a temple, and a cemetery.&nbsp; The road onward
to Boroughbridge is, indeed, carried over a Roman way, which
itself probably superseded the tracks of those vanished people,
and led to what is now the village of Aldborough near
Boroughbridge, <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>once that great Roman city of Isurium which rivalled
York itself, and now yields inexhaustible building-stones for
modern cottages, and relics that bring the life of those ancients
in very close touch with that of our own time: oyster-shells and
oyster knives, pomatum-pots, pins, and the hundred little
articles in daily use now and fifteen hundred years ago.</p>
<p>Boroughbridge was originally the settlement founded by the
Saxons near the ruined and deserted city of Isurium.&nbsp; Afraid
of the bogies and evil spirits with which their dark
superstitions peopled the ruins, they dared not live there, but
built their abiding-place by the river Ure, where the
medi&aelig;val, but now modernised, village of Boroughbridge
stood, and where the bridge built by Metcalf, the blind road- and
bridge-maker, over a century ago spans the weedy stream in useful
but highly unornamental manner.&nbsp; The battle of
Boroughbridge, fought in 1322, is almost forgotten, and coaching
times have left their impress upon the town instead.&nbsp; The
two chief coaching inns, the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; and the
&ldquo;Greyhounds,&rdquo; still face one another in the dull
street; the &ldquo;Greyhounds&rdquo; a mere ghost of its former
self, the &ldquo;Crown&rdquo; larger, but its stables, where a
hundred horses found a shelter, now echoing in their emptiness to
the occasional footfall.&nbsp; Oddly enough a medical
practitioner, a Dr. Hugh Stott, was landlord of the
&ldquo;Crown&rdquo; for more than fifty years.&nbsp; Probably he
and the landlord of the &ldquo;Angel&rdquo; at Ferrybridge were
the only two inn-keeping doctors in the kingdom.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Crown&rdquo; was anciently the home of the Tancreds, a
county family owning property in the neighbourhood: the
&ldquo;Greyhounds&rdquo; obtains its curious plural from the
heraldic shield of the Mauleverers, which displays three
greyhounds, &ldquo;courant.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hotel accommodation was
greatly in request at Boroughbridge in the old days; for from
this point branched many roads.&nbsp; Here the Glasgow coaches
turned off, and a number of coaches for Knaresborough, Ripon,
Harrogate, and the many towns of south-west Yorkshire.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Edinburgh Express,&rdquo; which went by way of Glasgow,
also passed <a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>through.&nbsp; Boroughbridge was a busy coaching town,
so that ruin, stark, staring, and complete fell upon it when
railways came.</p>
<p>The remaining nineteen miles to Northallerton scarce call for
detailed description.&nbsp; Kirkby Hill, a mile out of
Boroughbridge, lies to the left, its church-tower just within
sight.&nbsp; This is followed by the unutterably dull, lifeless,
and ugly village of Dishforth, leading to the hamlet of Asenby,
where the road descends to the picturesque crossing of the Swale
and the Cod Beck, with the village of Topcliffe crowning the
ridge on the other side: a village better looking, but as
lifeless as the others.&nbsp; Thence flat or gently undulating
roads conduct in twelve miles to Northallerton, past Busby Stoop
Inn, the villages of Sand Hutton, Newsham, and North and South
Otterington.</p>
<p>South Otterington lives with a black mark in the memory of
antiquaries as that benighted place where the parishioners
thought so little of their church registers some years ago that
they allowed the parish clerk to treat all the old ones, dating
from before the eighteenth century, as so much waste-paper; some
of them making an excellent bonfire to singe a goose with.&nbsp;
They were not singular in this respect, for churchwardens of
different places have been known to do the most extraordinary
things with these valuable documents.&nbsp; Thoresby, the
antiquary, writing of a particular register, remarks that
&ldquo;it has not been a plaything for young pointers.&nbsp; It
has not occupied a bacon-cratch or a bread-and-cheese
cupboard.&nbsp; It has not been scribbled on, within and
without,&rdquo; from which we infer that that was the common
fate, and that others had been so treated.</p>
<p>The junction of the two main routes of the Great North Road at
Northallerton takes place ignominiously outside the goods station
at a level-crossing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> alternative route now described
and Northallerton regained by it, we may resume the long journey
to Edinburgh.&nbsp; It is the completest kind of change from the
wild ups and downs of the Boroughbridge and Wetherby route to the
long featureless stretches that now lie before us.&nbsp; We will
not linger in the town, but press onward to where the battle of
the Standard, as the battle of Northallerton is often known, was
fought, on the right-hand side of the road, near the still
unenclosed fragments of Cowton Moor.&nbsp; It was not a great
struggle, for the Scots fled after a short resistance, and the
great numbers of their slain met their fate rather at the hands
of the peasantry, while fleeing through a hostile country, than
in combat with the English army.</p>
<p>Standing amid the heathy tussocks of Standard Hill, looking
over the Moor, the wide-spreading hill and dale of the Yorkshire
landscape fades into a blue or misty distance, and must in its
solitude look much the same as it did in those far distant
days.&nbsp; Nothing save the name of the hillock and that of the
farm called Scot Pits, traditionally said to have been the place
where the Scottish dead were buried, remains to tell of the
struggle.&nbsp; &ldquo;Baggamoor,&rdquo; as old chroniclers call
the battle-field, from the baggage thrown away by the Scots in
their flight, is traversed by the road, which proceeds by way of
Oak Tree and Lovesome Hills to Great Smeaton, where the mails
changed horses on the short seven miles&rsquo; stage between it
and Northallerton, or the nine miles to Darlington.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;Blacksmith&rsquo;s Arms&rdquo; was in those times the
coaching inn here, but it has long since been converted into
cottages.&nbsp; William Tweedie, the last of a succession of
three Tweedies who kept the &ldquo;Blacksmith&rsquo;s Arms&rdquo;
and owed their prosperity to the mails changing at their house,
was also the village postmaster.&nbsp; A God-fearing man and an
absent-minded, it is recorded of him that during a <a
name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>sermon at the
parish church he was surprised in the midst of one of his mental
absences by hearing the preacher enlarge upon the text of
&ldquo;Render unto C&aelig;sar.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Ay,&rdquo; he
said, in a loud voice, when the duty of paying the king&rsquo;s
taxes and just demands was brought home to the congregation,
&ldquo;that puts me in mind o&rsquo;t: there&rsquo;s old Granny
Metcalf&rsquo;s bin owin&rsquo; the matter o&rsquo; eightpence on
a letter these two months past.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now Widow Metcalf <i>had</i> paid that eightpence.&nbsp; She
was in church, too.&nbsp; The suddenness of the unjust accusation
made her forget time and place, and she retorted with,
&ldquo;William Tweedie, y&rsquo;re a liar!&rdquo;</p>
<p>One has a distinct suspicion that by &ldquo;Lowsey Hill, a
small Village contiguous on the Left&rdquo; (but a place so-named
would more properly have been &ldquo;contagious&rdquo;) mentioned
here by Ogilby, he must have meant what is now Lovesome Hill.</p>
<p>The old coach passengers, driving through, or changing at,
Great Smeaton must have often wondered, seeing the smallness of
the place, what size the neighbouring Little Smeaton, away off to
the left, could have been.&nbsp; Their inquiries on that head
were usually answered by the coachmen, who were wags of sorts,
that Little Smeaton consisted of one dog-kennel and two
hen-coops.&nbsp; It is a lonely road between Northallerton and
Darlington, and quips of this kind probably tasted better when
administered on the spot than they do to the armchair
traveller.&nbsp; Particularly lonely is High Entercommon, where a
turnpike-gate stood in the days that are done, together with an
inn, the &ldquo;Golden Lion,&rdquo; where a few coaches which
made a longer stage from Northallerton changed.&nbsp; Were it not
that William Thompson, landlord at the best period in the history
of coaching, was a highly reputable person, and had been coachman
to Sir Bellingham Graham before he set up as innkeeper, we might
point to the house and say how suitable a locality for the secret
roadside crimes of old, of which novelists delight to tell!&nbsp;
Roads, and travelling before railways, used to set the romancists
busily engaged in spinning the most <a name="page89"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 89</span>blood-curdling stories of villainous
innkeepers who, like Bob Acres, kept &ldquo;churchyards of their
own,&rdquo; and murderous trap-doors in their guest-rooms giving
upon Golgothas filled with the bones of their many victims.&nbsp;
If one might credit these astounding stories, the inns that were
not murder-shops were few and far between; but happily those
writers, anxious only to make your blood creep, were as a rule
only exercising their particularly gory imaginations.</p>
<p>A story of this order is that of a lady who set out in her
carriage to visit some friends in Yorkshire.&nbsp; She had come
to within thirty miles of her destination, when a thunderstorm
which had been threatening broke violently overhead.&nbsp;
Struggling against the elements, the coachman was glad to espy an
old-fashioned roadside inn presently visible ahead, and, his
mistress expressing a wish to alight and rest until the storm
should abate, he drove up to the door.&nbsp; It was a wild and
solitary spot (they always are in these stories, and it is
astonishing how solitary and wild they are, and how many such
places appeared to exist).&nbsp; The rusty sign creaked dismally
overhead, and the window-shutters flapped violently in the wind
on their broken hinges; altogether it was not an inviting
spot.&nbsp; But any port in a storm, and so the lady
alighted.&nbsp; She was shown into a large old-fashioned
apartment, and the horses and carriage were stabled until such
time as it might be possible to resume the journey.&nbsp; But,
instead of passing off, the storm grew momentarily worse.&nbsp;
Calling her servant she asked him if it were possible to continue
that night, and on his replying in the negative, reluctantly
resigned herself to staying under a strange roof.&nbsp; She had
her dinner in solitary state, and then found all the evening
before her, with nothing to occupy the time.&nbsp; She went to
the window and looked out upon the howling storm, and, tired of
that uninviting prospect, gazed listlessly about the room.&nbsp;
It was a large room, ill-furnished, and somewhat out of repair,
for the inn had seen its best days.&nbsp; Evidences of a more
prosperous time were left in the shape of <a
name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>some
scattered articles of furniture of a superior kind and in the
presence of a curious piece of ancient tapestry facing her on the
opposite wall, bearing a design of a life-sized Roman warrior
wielding a truncheon.</p>
<p>But one cannot spend all the evening in contemplating the old
chairs and moth-eaten tapestry of a half-furnished room, and the
storm-bound traveller soon wearied of those objects.&nbsp; With
nothing else to do, she took out her purse and began to count her
money and to calculate her travelling expenses.&nbsp; Having
counted the guineas over several times and vainly tried to make
the total balance properly with her expenditure and the amount
she had set out with, she chanced involuntarily to glance across
the room.&nbsp; Her gaze fell upon the stern visage of the
helmeted Roman, and to her horror the lack-lustre tapestry eyes
were now replaced by living ones, intently regarding her and her
money.&nbsp; Ninety-nine of every hundred women would have
screamed or fainted, or have done both; but our traveller was
evidently the hundredth.&nbsp; She calmly allowed her gaze to
wander absent-mindedly away to the ceiling, as if still
speculating as to the disposition of the missing odd guineas; and
then, exclaiming, &ldquo;Ah! I have it,&rdquo; made for the door,
to call her servant, leaving her purse, apparently disregarded,
on the table.&nbsp; In the passage outside she met the landlord,
who desired to know what it might be she wanted.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
see my man, with orders for the morning,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp;
The landlord shuffled away, and her servant presently
appeared.&nbsp; She told him what she had observed, and mounting
upon the furniture, he examined the tapestry, with the result
that he found the wall behind it sound enough in all places, with
the exception of the eyes.&nbsp; On pressing the fabric at those
points it gave way, disclosing a hole bored through the wall and
communicating with some other room.&nbsp; This discovery of
course aroused the worst suspicions; but the storm still raged,
it was now late, and to countermand the accommodation already
secured for the night <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>would be to apprise the landlord of
something having been discovered.&nbsp; There was nothing for it
but to stay the night.&nbsp; To sleep was impossible, and so the
lady, retiring to her bedroom, securely bolting the door, and
assuring herself that no secret panel or trap-door existed, sat
wakefully in a chair all night.&nbsp; Doubtless the servant did
the same, although the story does not condescend to details where
he is concerned.&nbsp; At length morning came, without anything
happening, and, equally without incident, they set out after
breakfast from this place of dread, the lady having previously
ascertained that the room on the other side of the wall behind
the tapestry was the landlord&rsquo;s private apartment.</p>
<p>These adventures being afterwards recounted, it was called to
mind that an undue proportion of highway robberies had for some
time past been occurring in the immediate neighbourhood of the
inn, and a queer story was remembered of a traveller who had
stayed there overnight being robbed soon after leaving by a
highwayman, who, without any preliminary parley, desired him to
instantly take off his right boot&mdash;the boot in which, as a
matter of fact, he had stowed away his money.&nbsp; The
highwayman, who evidently had been informed of this secret
hiding-place, extracted the coin, and, returning the boot, went
on his way.&nbsp; It afterwards appeared that the traveller had
stowed his money in his boot while under the impression that he
was alone in the tapestry-room.&nbsp; He had reckoned without the
Centurion.</p>
<p>The inn of course fell into evil repute, and the landlord was
soon afterwards compelled to give up business.&nbsp; But the
provoking part of it all, from the point of view of the
historian, is that the story does not descend to topographical
particulars, and that the description of the place as being in
Yorkshire is necessarily of the vaguest, considering the vastness
of the shire.</p>
<h2><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>XVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Dalton-upon-Tees</span>, three miles
onward from High and Low Entercommon, shows little to the
passer-by on the Great North Road, who, a mile beyond its
scattered cottages, looking as though they had lost themselves,
comes to Croft, to the river Tees, and to the end of
Yorkshire.&nbsp; It behoves one to speak respectfully of Croft
and its Spa, for its waters are as nasty as those of Harrogate,
with that flavour of rotten eggs so highly approved by the
medical profession, and only the vagaries of fashion can be held
accountable for the comparative neglect of the one and the
favouring of the other.&nbsp; Sulphur renders both equally
nauseous and healthful, but Croft finds few votaries compared
with its great and successful rival, and a gentle melancholy
marks the spot, where, on the Yorkshire bank, the mouldy-looking
Croft Spa Hotel fronts the road, its closed assembly rooms, where
once the merry crowds foregathered, given over to damp and
mildew.</p>
<p>Croft is in the Hurworth Hunt, and it is claimed by local folk
that the Hurworth Country was indicated by &ldquo;Handley
Cross,&rdquo; where Jorrocks and his cronies chased the fox and
enjoyed themselves so vigorously.&nbsp; The Spa Hotel was then a
place of extremely high jinks.&nbsp; Every night there would be a
dinner-party, with much competition as to who could drink the
most port or champagne.&nbsp; The test of the sturdiest fellow
was to see who could manage to place on his head a champagne or
port bottle and lie down and stand up with it still in
place.&nbsp; Few reputations, or bottles, survived that
ordeal.</p>
<p>But Croft is a pretty place, straggling on both the Yorkshire
and Durham banks of the Tees; with a fine old church commanding
the approach from the south.&nbsp; It is worth seeing, alike for
its architecture; for a huge and preposterous monument of one of
the Milbankes of Halnaby; and especially for the <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>extravagantly-arrogant manorial pew of that family,
erected in the chancel, and elevated in the likeness of two
canopied thrones approached by an elaborate staircase and over a
crimson carpet.&nbsp; This pompous structure dates from about
1760.&nbsp; The thing would not be credible, did not we know to
what extent the pride and presumption of the old squirearchy
sometimes went.</p>

<p>A sturdy old Gothic bridge here carries the road across the
stream into the ancient Palatinate of Durham.&nbsp; It were here
that each successive Prince-Bishop of that see was met and
presented with the falchion that slew the Sockburn Worm, one of
the three mythical monsters that are said to have infested Durham
and Northumberland.&nbsp; Like the Lambton Worm, and the
Laidly&mdash;that is to say, the Loathly&mdash;Worm of
Spindleston Heugh, the Sockburn terror, according to
medi&aelig;val chroniclers, was a &ldquo;monstrous and poysonous
vermine or wyverne, aske or werme which overthrew and devoured
many people in fight, for y<sup>t</sup> ye sent of y<sup>e</sup>
poyson was so strong y<sup>t</sup> noe p&rsquo;son might abyde
it.&rdquo;&nbsp; The gallant knight who at some undetermined
period slew this legendary pest was Sir John Conyers, descended
from Roger de Conyers, Constable of Durham Castle in the time of
William the Conqueror.&nbsp; The family held the manor of <a
name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 94</span>Sockburn by
the curious tenure of presenting the newly appointed Bishop
Palatine of Durham on his first entry into his diocese with the
falchion that slew the Worm.&nbsp; The presentation was made on
Croft Bridge, with the words:&mdash;&ldquo;My Lord Bishop, I here
present you with the falchion wherewith the champion Conyers slew
the worm, dragon, or fiery flying serpent which destroyed man,
woman and child; in memory of which the king then reigning gave
him the manor of Sockburn, to hold by this tenure, that upon the
first entrance of every bishop into the county the falchion
should be presented.&rdquo;&nbsp; Taking the falchion into his
hand, the bishop immediately returned it, wishing the owner of
Sockburn health, long life, and prosperity, and the ceremony was
concluded.&nbsp; Sockburn, seven miles below Croft, on the Durham
shore of the Tees, is no longer owned by that old heroic family,
for the proud stock which in its time had mated with the noblest
in England decayed, and the last Conyers, Sir Thomas, died a
pauper in Chester-le-Street workhouse in 1810. The manor-house of
Sockburn has long since been swept away, and the old church is a
roofless ruin, the estate itself having long since passed to the
Blackett family, in whose possession the wondrous falchion now
remains.&nbsp; The bishops of Durham, no longer temporal princes,
do not now receive it, the last presentation having been made to
Bishop Van Mildert by the steward of Sir Edward Blackett in
1826.</p>

</a>Croft Bridge, a massive and venerable-looking stone structure
of seven arches, built in 1676, is itself the successor of a much
older building, referred to in a Royal Brief of 1531 as being
&ldquo;the moste directe and sure waye and passage for the King
o&rsquo;er Soveraigne <a name="page95"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 95</span>Lorde&rsquo;s armie and
ordyn&rsquo;ce to resort and pass over into the north p&rsquo;tes

the same againste the invasion of the Scotts and others his
enemyes, over which such armys and ordyn&rsquo;ces hathe hertofor
always bene accostomyed to goo and passe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here we are in Durham, and three miles from Darlington.&nbsp;
Looking backwards on crossing the bridge, the few scattered
houses of the hither shore are seen beside the way; one of them,
the &ldquo;Cornet&rdquo; hotel, with a weather-beaten
picture-sign of the famous pedigree bull of that name, and the
inscription, &ldquo;&lsquo;Comet,&rsquo; sold in 1810 for one
thousand guineas.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Tees goes on its rippling way
through the pointed arches of the historic bridge, with broad
shingly beaches over against the rich meadows, the road pursuing
its course to cross that rival stream, the Skerne, at Oxneyfield
Bridge, a quarter of a mile ahead.&nbsp; Close by, in a grass
meadow to the right of the road, are the four pools called by the
terrific name of &ldquo;Hell&rsquo;s Kettles,&rdquo; which
testify by the sulphureous taste of their water to the quality of
Croft Spa.&nbsp; Of course, they have their wonderful legends;
Ogilby in 1676 noted that.&nbsp; &ldquo;At Oxenhall,&rdquo; he
says, &ldquo;are three Pits call&rsquo;d Hell-kettles, whereof
the vulgar tell you many fabulous stories.&rdquo;&nbsp; They have
long been current, then; the first telling how on Christmas Day
1179 the ground rose to the height of the highest hills,
&ldquo;higher than the spires and towers of the churches, and so
remained at that height from nine of the morning until
sunset.&nbsp; At the setting of the sun the earth fell in with so
horrid a crash that all who saw that strange mound and heard its
fall were so amazed that for very fear many died, for the earth
swallowed up that mound, and where it stood was a deep
pool.&rdquo;&nbsp; This circumstantial story was told by an abbot
of Jervaulx, but is not sufficiently marvellous for the
peasantry, who account for the pool by a tale of supernatural
intervention.&nbsp; According to this precious legend, the farmer
owning the field being about to carry his hay on June 11, St.
Barnabas&rsquo; <a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>Day, it was pointed out that he had much better attend
to his religious duties than work on the anniversary of the
blessed saint, whereupon he replied:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Barnaby yea, Barnaby nay,<br />
I&rsquo;ll hae my hay, whether God will or nay:</p>
</blockquote>
<p>and, the ground opening, he and his carts and horses were
instantly swallowed up.&nbsp; The tale goes on to say that, given
a fine day and clear water, the impious farmer and his carts and
horses may yet be seen floating deep down in these supposedly
fathomless pools!&nbsp; De Foe, however, travelling this way in
1724, is properly impatient of these tales.&nbsp;
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis evident,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;they are
nothing but old coal-pits, filled with water by the river
Tees.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Darlington</span>, to which we now come,
is a very busy, very prosperous, very much rebuilt town, nursing
a sub-Metropolitan swagger of architectural pretension in its
chief streets infinitely unlike anything expected by the
untravelled in these latitudes.&nbsp; There is a distinctly
Holloway Road&mdash;plus Whitechapel Road&mdash;and Kennington
Lane air about Darlington which does but add to the piquancy of
those streets.&nbsp; Tumbledown houses of no great age and no
conceivable interest are shouldered by flaunting shops; or
rather, to speak by the card, by &ldquo;stores&rdquo; and
&ldquo;emporia&rdquo;; these alternating with glittering
public-houses and restaurants.&nbsp; The effect can be paralleled
only by imagining a typical general servant dressed in a skirt
and train for a Queen&rsquo;s Drawing Room, with
ploughboy&rsquo;s boots, a cloth jacket, and ostrich-feathered
hat to complete the costume.&nbsp; It is a town only now
beginning to realise that prosperity must make some outward show
of the fact, and it is accordingly going in for show in
whole-hearted fashion, and emerging from the grime in which James
the First found it in 1617.&nbsp; &ldquo;Darneton!&rdquo; <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>he said when
told its name; &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s Darneton th&rsquo;
Dirt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Dirty indeed it must have been for James,
fresh from his own capital, where they flung their sewage from
the windows into the streets, to have found it remarkable.&nbsp;
De Foe, fifty years later, said, &ldquo;Darlington, a post-town,
has nothing remarkable in it but dirt, and a high bridge over
little or no water.&rdquo;&nbsp; An odd contemporary commentary
upon this seems to lurk in the fact that cloth was then brought
to Darlington from all parts&mdash;even from Scotland&mdash;to be
bleached!</p>
<p>More akin to those times than these are the names of the
streets, which, like those of York, are chiefly
&ldquo;gates&rdquo;:&mdash;High Northgate, Skinnergate, Bondgate,
Blackwellgate, and Priestgate.</p>
<p>In vain will the pilgrim seek the &ldquo;Black Bear,&rdquo;
the inn at Darlington to which Frank Osbaldistone, in the pages
of <i>Rob Roy</i>, came.&nbsp; Scott describes the wayfarers whom
the young squire met on his way from London to York and the North
as &ldquo;characters of a uniform and uninteresting
description,&rdquo; but they are interesting to us, belonging as
they do to a time long past.&nbsp; &ldquo;Country parsons,
jogging homewards after a visitation; farmers, or graziers,
returning from a distant market; clerks of traders, travelling to
collect what was due to their masters in provincial towns; with
now and then an officer going down into the country upon
recruiting service.&rdquo;&nbsp; These persons kept the tapsters
and the turnpikes busy, and at night time, when they foregathered
at the roadside inns, sandwiched their talk of cattle and the
solvency of traders with terrifying tales of robbers.&nbsp;
&ldquo;At such tales, like children, closing their circle round
the fire when the ghost-story draws to its climax, they drew near
to each other, looked before and behind them, examined the
priming of their pistols, and vowed to stand by each other in
case of danger; an engagement which, like other offensive and
defensive alliances, sometimes glided out of remembrance when
there was an appearance of actual peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was about 1715.&nbsp; In those days, as Scott says, <a
name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>&ldquo;journeys of any length being made on horseback,
and, of course, by brief stages, it was usual always to make a
halt on the Sunday in some town where the traveller might attend
divine service, and his horse have the benefit of the day of
rest.&nbsp; A counterpart to this decent practice, and a remnant
of old English hospitality, was, that the landlord of a principal
inn laid aside his character of publican on the seventh day and
invited the guests who chanced to be within his walls to take a
part of the family beef and pudding.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>The &ldquo;Black Bear&rdquo; at Darlington, as pictured by
Scott, was such a place and the landlord as typical a host, and
here Frank Osbaldistone met the first Scot he had ever seen,
&ldquo;a decentish hallion&mdash;as canny a North Briton as
e&rsquo;er crossed Berwick Bridge&rdquo;&mdash;which was high
praise from mine host, for innkeepers loved not Scottish folk and
their thrifty ways.&nbsp; But, as already remarked, the
&ldquo;Black Bear&rdquo; at Darlington does not exist, and
coaching relics are rare in this town, whose modern prosperity
derives from railways.&nbsp; It is, therefore, with singular
appropriateness that Stephenson&rsquo;s &ldquo;Locomotion,&rdquo;
the first engine for that first of railways, the Stockton and
Darlington, long <a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>since withdrawn from service, has been mounted on a
pedestal at Darlington Station.&nbsp; In heathen lands this
ancestor of the modern express locomotive would be worshipped as
a fetich, and truly it is an ugly and uncanny-looking object.</p>

<img alt=
"&ldquo;The Experiment&rdquo;"
title=
"&ldquo;The Experiment&rdquo;"
 src="images/p99.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>The Stockton and Darlington Railway Act dates from 1821; the
line to be worked by &ldquo;men and horses, or otherwise,&rdquo;
steam not being contemplated.&nbsp; The construction was begun in
May, 1822, and meanwhile the Rainhill experiments had proved the
possibility of locomotive engines.&nbsp; The Act was therefore
amended, to authorise the use of them and to permit the
conveyance of passengers; a kind of traffic which, odd though it
may seem now, was not contemplated by the projectors, whose
original idea was a railway for the conveyance of coal.&nbsp; It
was on September 27th, 1825, that the line was opened, a train of
thirty-eight wagons travelling, as a contemporary newspaper
breathlessly announced, &ldquo;with such velocity that in some
parts the speed was frequently twelve miles an hour.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Curiously enough, however, the first passengers, after the
opening ceremony, were conveyed, not by steam, but by a rough
coach, like a gipsy caravan, running on the rails and drawn by a
horse.&nbsp; This odd contrivance was called the
&ldquo;Experiment,&rdquo; <a name="page100"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 100</span>and did the twelve miles in two
hours.&nbsp; It was followed by other vehicles, consisting of old
stage-coach bodies mounted on railway wheels, and it was not
until some months had passed that passengers were intrusted to
the locomotive.&nbsp; The first passenger train ran a spirited
race with the coach over the twelve miles&rsquo; course, steam
winning by a hundred and twenty yards, amid the cheers of excited
crowds.&nbsp; After thirty-eight years of independent existence,
the Stockton and Darlington line was, with its branches, finally
absorbed into the North-Eastern system, in 1863.</p>
<p>Darlington is thus a place entirely inimical to coaching
interests and memories.&nbsp; Here, on its pedestal, stands the
first of the iron monsters that killed the coaches, and the town
itself largely lives by manufacturing railway wagons and iron and
steel bridges.&nbsp; But coaching had had its day, and did not
die untimely.&nbsp; A few years longer and the great highroads,
already inconveniently crowded, must have been widened to
accommodate the increased traffic.&nbsp; Railways have been
beneficent in many directions, and they have enabled many
hundreds of thousands to live in the country who would otherwise
have been pent in stuffy streets.&nbsp; Imagination fails in the
task of endeavouring to picture what the roads would have been
like to-day if road-travel had remained the only means of
communication.&nbsp; Locomotion would have been immensely
restricted, of course; but the mere increase of population must
have brought huge crowds of additional passengers.&nbsp; Figures
are commonly said to be dry, but they can occasionally be
eloquent enough.&nbsp; For instance, when we compare the
population of the United Kingdom in 1837, when the Queen came to
the throne, and now, and consider the bearing of those figures on
this question, they are more than eloquent, and are even
startling.&nbsp; There were twenty-five and a half millions of
persons in these islands in the first year of Victoria&rsquo;s
reign.&nbsp; There are now forty-nine millions.&nbsp; Over
twenty-three millions of persons most of whom would have used the
roads, added <a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>in eighty years!&nbsp; Of course, the opportunities for
cheap and quick travel have made frequent travellers of those who
otherwise would never or rarely have stirred from their homes;
but railways have wrought greater changes than that.&nbsp; What,
let us think, would have been the present-day position of the
city of London without railways?&nbsp; It must needs have
remained largely what it was when the &ldquo;short stages&rdquo;
conveyed such citizens as did not live in the city to and from
their residences in the suburbs, which then extended no further
than Highgate, Chiswick, Norwood, and Stockwell.&nbsp; A
stage-coach commonly held sixteen persons, twelve outside and
four in; and allowing for those who might manage to walk into the
city, how many of such coaches should we require nowadays,
supposing railways suddenly abolished, to convey the city&rsquo;s
myriad day population?&nbsp; So many thousands that the task
would be impossible.&nbsp; The impossibility of it gives us at
once the measure of the railways&rsquo; might, and raises them
from the mere carriers we generally think them to the height of
all-powerful social forces whose effects may be sought in every
detail of our lives.&nbsp; To them the wide-spreading suburbs
directly owe their existence, equally as the deserted main roads
of yester-year owed their loneliness to the same cause; and
social scientists have it that they have performed what may at
first sight seem a miracle: that, in fact, they have increased
the population.&nbsp; If railways had not come to ease the
growing pressure that began to be felt upon the roads in the
early &ldquo;twenties,&rdquo; something else must have appeared
to do the work of speedy conveyance, and that something would
have been the Motor Car.&nbsp; Railway competition and the
restrictive legislation that forbade locomotive carriages on
highways served to keep motor cars under until recently; but away
back to 1787, when the first steam-carriage was made, the problem
of mechanical traction on roads was being grappled with, and many
very good steam-cars made their appearance between 1820 and
1830.&nbsp; The caricaturists of the period were <a
name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 104</span>kept busily
engaged making more or less pertinent fun of them; in itself a
testimony to the interest they were exciting even then.&nbsp;
Here is a typical skit of the period which takes a renewed
interest now that we are on the threshold of an era of horseless
traction.</p>

<p>Few things are more remarkable than the speed with which
railways were constructed through the length and breadth of the
country, but it was long before through communication between
London and Edinburgh was established.&nbsp; It was a coach-guard
on this road who, just before the last coach was run off it by
the locomotive, sadly remarked that &ldquo;railways were making a
gridiron of England.&rdquo;&nbsp; They were; but it was not until
1846 and 1848, twenty-one and twenty-three years after the
initial success of the Stockton and Darlington line, that by the
opening of the Edinburgh and Berwick Railway, and the building of
the railway bridge across the Tweed, the last links of the
railway journey between the two capitals were completed.&nbsp;
Even now, it requires the united efforts of three entirely
distinct and independent railway companies to convey the through
traffic of under four hundred miles between the two
capitals.&nbsp; The Great Northern territory ends at Shaftholme,
near Doncaster, whence the North-Eastern&rsquo;s system conducts
to the Border at Berwick-upon-Tweed, the remaining fifty miles
belonging to the North British Railway.</p>
<p>De Quincey, in his rhapsody on the &ldquo;English Mail
Coach,&rdquo; says: &ldquo;The modern modes of travelling cannot
compare with the old mail-coach system in grandeur and
power.&nbsp; They boast of more velocity, not, however, as a
consciousness, but as a fact of our lifeless knowledge, resting
upon alien evidence; as, for instance, because somebody says that
we have gone fifty miles in the hour, though we are far from
feeling it as a personal experience, or upon the evidence of a
result, as that actually we find ourselves in York, four hours
after leaving London.&nbsp; Apart from such an assertion, or such
a result, I myself am little aware of the pace.&nbsp; But, seated
on the old mail-coach, we needed no <a name="page105"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 105</span>evidence out of ourselves to
indicate the velocity.&nbsp; We heard our speed, we saw it, we
felt it as a thrilling; and this speed was not the product of
blind, insensate agencies, that had no sympathy to give, but was
incarnated in the fiery eyeballs of the noblest amongst brutes,
in his dilated nostrils, spasmodic muscles, and thunder-beating
hoofs.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>But, in truth, railways and coaches have each their especial
variety of the romance of speed.&nbsp; De Quincey missed the
quickening rush and contact of the air quite as much as any other
of the sights, sounds, and sensations he speaks of when
travelling by railway; a method of progression which does not
admit of outside passengers.&nbsp; Nothing in its special way can
be more exhilarating than travelling by coach as an
&ldquo;outside&rdquo;; few things so unsatisfactory as the
position of an &ldquo;inside&rdquo;; and if a well-groomed coach
is a thing of beauty, there is also a beautiful majesty in a
locomotive engine that has been equally well looked after.&nbsp;
One of the deep-chested Great Northern expresses puffing its
irresistible way past the green eyes of the dropped <a
name="page106"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 106</span>semaphores
of some busy junction at night-time, or coming as with the rush
and certainty of Fate along the level stretches of line that
characterise the route of the iron road to the North, is a sight
calculated to rouse enthusiasm quite as much as a coach.&nbsp;
Nor are railways always hideous objects.&nbsp; It is true that in
and around the great centres of population where railway lines
converge and run in filthy tunnels and along smoke-begrimed
viaducts they sound the last note of squalor, but in the country
it is a different matter.&nbsp; The embankments are in spring
often covered with a myriad wild flowers; the viaducts give a
human interest to coombe and gully.&nbsp; Lovers of the country
can certainly point to places which, once remote and solitary,
have been populated and spoiled by the readiness of railway
access; but the locomotive has rendered more holidays possible,
and has kept the roads in a decent solitude for the
cyclist.&nbsp; Imagine, if you please, the Great North Road
nowadays without the railway.&nbsp; A hundred coaches, more or
less, raced along it in the last years of the coaching age, at
all hours of the day and night.&nbsp; How many would suffice for
the needs of the travelling public to-day? and what chance would
be left to the tourist, afoot or awheel?</p>
<h2>XIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Beyond</span> its grand old church,
Darlington has nothing of great antiquity to show the stranger,
save one object of very high antiquity indeed, before whose hoary
age even Norman and Early English architecture is comparatively a
thing of yesterday.&nbsp; This is the Bulmer Stone, a huge
boulder of granite, brought by glacial action in some far-away
ice-age from the heights of Shap Fell in distant Westmoreland to
the spot on which it has ever since rested.&nbsp; Darlington has
meanwhile risen out of the void and lonely countryside; history
has passed by, from the remote times of the blue-stained Britons,
down to the present era of the <a name="page107"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 107</span>blue-habited police; and that old
stone remains beside the road to the North.&nbsp; Modern
pavements encircle it, and gas-lamps shame with their modernity
its inconceivable age, but not with too illuminating a ray, and
the stranger roaming Darlington after nightfall has barked his
shins against the unexpected bulk of the Bulmer Stone, just as
effectually as countless generations before him have done.</p>
<p>The long rise of Harrowgate Hill conducts out of Darlington
and leads on to Coatham Mundeville, a tiny hamlet on the crest of
a hill, with an eighteenth-century house, a row of cottages, and
an inn, making together an imposing figure against the sky-line,
although when reached they are commonplace enough.&nbsp; The
village of Aycliffe lies beyond, on its height, overlooking a
scene of quarrying and coal-mining; an outlook which until
Cromwell&rsquo;s time was one of dense oak-woods.&nbsp; He it was
who caused those woods to be felled to mend the road on to Durham
and make it firm enough for his ordnance to pass.&nbsp; Whether
the name of Aycliffe derives (as some would have it) from
&ldquo;oak hill,&rdquo; or whether it was originally &ldquo;High
Cliffe,&rdquo; or obtains its name from some forgotten
<i>haia</i>, or enclosure on this eminence, let us leave for
others to fight over: it is an equally unprofitable and insoluble
discussion.&nbsp; As well might one hope to obtain a verbatim
report of one or other of the two Synods held here in 782 and
789, of which two battered Saxon crosses in the churchyard are
thought to be relics, as to determine this question.</p>
<p>For the rest, Aycliffe is quite unremarkable.&nbsp; Leaving
it, and coming downhill over an arched crossing over a marsh,
dignified by the name of Howden Bridge, we reach
Traveller&rsquo;s Rest and its two inns, the &ldquo;Bay
Horse&rdquo; and &ldquo;Gretna Green Wedding Inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; An
indescribable air of romance dignifies these two solitary inns
that confront one another across the highway, and form all there
is of Traveller&rsquo;s Rest.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Wedding
Inn,&rdquo; the more modern of the two, has for its sign the
picture of a marriage ceremony in that famous Border
smithy.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Bay Horse&rdquo; is the original
Traveller&rsquo;s <a name="page108"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
108</span>Rest.&nbsp; Dating back far into the old coaching and
posting times, its stables of that era still remain; but what
renders the old house particularly notable is its sign, the odd
figure of a horse within an oval, seen on its wall, with the word
&ldquo;Liberty&rdquo; in company with the name of
&ldquo;Traveller&rsquo;s Rest&rdquo; and the less romantic than
commercial announcement of &ldquo;Spirituous
Liquors.&rdquo;&nbsp; Once, perhaps, painted the correct tint of
a &ldquo;bay&rdquo; horse, the elements have reduced it to an
unobtrusive brown that bids fair to modestly fade into the
obscurity of a neutral tint, unless the landlord presently
fulfils his intention, expressed to the present historian, of
having it repainted, to render it &ldquo;more viewly&rdquo;;
which appears to be the North-country phrase for making a thing
&ldquo;more presentable.&rdquo;&nbsp; To this old sign belongs
the legend of a prisoner being escorted to Durham Gaol and
escaping through the horse ridden by his mounted guard throwing
its rider near here.&nbsp; Hence the word
&ldquo;Liberty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Woodham, a mile distant down the road, bears a name recalling
the times when it was in fact a hamlet in those oak woods of
which we spoke at Aycliffe.&nbsp; It is now just a group of two
or three cottages and a <a name="page109"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 109</span>humble inn, the &ldquo;Stag,&rdquo;
in a dip of the way.&nbsp; Beyond it comes Rushyford Bridge, a
pretty scene, where a little tributary of the Skerne prattles
over its stony bed and disappears under the road beside that
old-time posting-house and inn, the
&ldquo;Wheatsheaf.&rdquo;&nbsp; The old house still stands and
faces down the road; but it has long since ceased to be an inn,
and, remodelled in recent taste, is now a private
residence.&nbsp; The old drive up to the house is now converted
into lawns and flower-beds.&nbsp; Groups of that graceful tree,
the black poplar, overhang the scene and shade the little hamlet
that straggles down a lane to the left hand.&nbsp; The old
&ldquo;Wheatsheaf&rdquo; has its memories.&nbsp; It was a
favourite resort of Lord Eldon&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Holt, the landlord,
was a boon companion of his.&nbsp; The great lawyer&rsquo;s
vacations were for many years spent here, and he established a
cellar of his own in the house, stocked chiefly with
&ldquo;Carbonell&rsquo;s Fine Old Military Blackstrap Newcastle
Port,&rdquo; of which, although they were decidedly not military,
he and his host used to drink seven bottles a day between them,
valiant topers that they were.&nbsp; On Saturdays&mdash;we have
it on the authority of Sydney Smith&mdash;they drank eight
bottles; the extra one being to fortify themselves against the
Sunday morning&rsquo;s service.&nbsp; Lord Eldon invariably
attended church at Rushyford, and compelled his unwilling host to
go with him.&nbsp; In London he rarely went, remarking when
reproached that he, <a name="page110"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 110</span>a buttress of the church, should
fail in his devotions, that he was &ldquo;only an outside
buttress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lord Eldon was a mean man.&nbsp; It is a defect to be noticed
in many others who, like him, have acquired wealth by great
personal efforts; with him, however, it reached a height and
quality not frequently met.&nbsp; He was not merely
&ldquo;stingy,&rdquo; but mean in the American sense of the
word.&nbsp; Contemporary with Fox, Pitt, Sheridan, and other
valiant &ldquo;four-bottle men&rdquo; of a century ago, and with
an almost unlimited capacity for other persons&rsquo; port, his
brother, Lord Stowell, aptly said of him that &ldquo;he would
take any <i>given</i> quantity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these memories to beguile the way we come to Ferryhill, a
mining village crowning a ridge looking over Spennymoor and the
valley of the Wear.&nbsp; To Ferryhill came in 1634 three
soldiers&mdash;a captain, a lieutenant, and an ensign&mdash;from
Norwich on a tour and in search of adventure.&nbsp; These were
early days for tours; days, too, when adventures were not far to
seek.&nbsp; However, risky though their trip may have been, they
returned in safety, as may be judged from the lieutenant having
afterwards published an account of their wanderings through
twenty-six English counties.&nbsp; Clad in Lincoln green, like
young foresters, they sped the miles with jest and observations
on the country they passed through.&nbsp; Of Ferryhill they
remark that &ldquo;such as know it knows it overtops and commands
a great part of the country.&rdquo;&nbsp; On this Pisgah, then,
they unpacked their travelling plate and &ldquo;borrowed a cup of
refreshing health from a sweet and most pleasant spring&rdquo;;
by which it seems that there were teetotallers in those days
also.&nbsp; Those were the days before coal-mines and
blast-furnaces cut up the country, and before Spennymoor, away on
the left, was converted from a moorland into a township; a
sufficiently startling change.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Seen from down the road looking southwards, Ferryhill forms an
impressive coronet to the long ridge of hill on which it stands;
its rough, stone-built cottages&mdash;merely commonplace to a
nearer view&mdash;taking an unwarranted importance from the <a
name="page112"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 112</span>bold
serrated outlines they present against the sky, and looking like
the bastioned outworks of some Giant Blunderbore&rsquo;s ogreish
stronghold.&nbsp; The traveller from the south, passing through
Ferryhill and looking backwards from the depths of the valley
road, is cheated of a part of this romantic impression; he has
explored the arid and commonplace village and has lost all
possibility of illusion.&nbsp; Let us, therefore, envy the
pilgrims from the north.&nbsp; It is, indeed, a highly
interesting view, looking back upon Ferryhill, and one touched
with romance of both the gentle and the terrifying sort.&nbsp; In
the first place, to that tall embankment seen in the accompanying
drawing of the scene belongs a story.&nbsp; You perceive that
earthwork to be unfinished.&nbsp; It sets out from the cutting
seen in the distant hillside, and, crossing the road which comes
in a breakneck curve downhill, pursues a straight and level
course for the corresponding rise on the hither side, stopping,
incomplete, somewhat short of it.&nbsp; &ldquo;An abandoned
railway,&rdquo; thinks the stranger, and so it looks to be; but
it is, in fact, a derelict enterprise embarked upon at the close
of the coaching era by a local Highway Board for the purpose of
giving a flat and straight road across the valley.&nbsp; It
begins with a long cutting on the southern side of the hill on
which the village stands, and, going behind the back of the
houses, emerges as seen in the picture.&nbsp; The tolls
authorised would have made the undertaking a paying one, only
road travel ceased before the work was finished.&nbsp; Railways
came to put an end to the project and to inflict upon the
projectors a ruinous loss.</p>
<p>A more darkling romance, however, broods upon the scene.&nbsp;
Away on the western sky-line stands the conspicuous tower of
Merrington church, and near it the farmhouse where, on January
28, 1685, Andrew Mills, a servant of the Brass family, who then
farmed the adjacent land, murdered the three children in the
absence of their parents.&nbsp; It is a story of whose shuddering
horror nothing is lost in contemporary accounts, but we will
leave it to the imagination.&nbsp; <a name="page113"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 113</span>It is sufficient to say that the
assassin, a lad of eighteen years of age, seems to have been
half-witted, speaking of having been instigated to the deed by a
demon who enjoined him to &ldquo;Kill&mdash;kill.&rdquo;&nbsp; To
be more or less mad was no surety against punishment in those
times, and so Andrew Mills was found guilty and hanged.&nbsp;
Justice seems to have been devilish then, for he was cut down and
hanged in chains, after the fashion of the time, beside the
road.&nbsp; The peculiar devilry of the deed appears in the fact
that he was not quite dead, and survived in his iron cage on the
gibbet for days.&nbsp; His sweetheart brought him food, but he
could not eat, for every movement of his jaw caused it to be
pierced with an iron spike.&nbsp; So she brought milk instead,
and so sustained the wretched creature for some time.&nbsp;
Legends still recount how he lingered here in agony, his cries by
day and night scaring the neighbouring cottagers from their
homes, until the shrieks and groans at length ceased, and death
came to put an end to his sufferings.&nbsp; The site of the
gibbet was by the Thinford inn, near the head of the
embankment.&nbsp; The gibbet-post lasted long.&nbsp; Known as
&ldquo;Andrew Mills&rsquo; Stob,&rdquo; its wood was reputed of
marvellous efficacy for toothache, rheumatism, heartburn, and
indeed as wide a range of ailments as are <a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>cured by
any one of the modern quack medicines that fill the advertisement
columns of our newspapers in this enlightened age.&nbsp; It was a
sad day for Ferryhill and the neighbourhood when the last
splinter of Andrew Mills&rsquo; gibbet was used up, and what the
warty, scrofulous, ulcerous, and rheumaticky inhabitants did then
the imagination refuses to consider.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> surrounding districts anciently
possessed a prime horror (which has lost nothing in the
accumulated legends of centuries) in the &ldquo;Brawn of
Brancepeth.&rdquo;&nbsp; This terror of the countryside, resolved
into plain matter of fact, seems to have been a wild boar.&nbsp;
Boars were &ldquo;brawns&rdquo; in those days, and the adjacent
&ldquo;Brancepeth&rdquo; is just &ldquo;brawn&rsquo;s
path,&rdquo; as Brandon is supposed to have been &ldquo;brawn
den.&rdquo;&nbsp; This, to modern ideas, not very terrible wild
animal, seems to have thoroughly alarmed half a
county:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>He feared not ye loute with hys staffe,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor yet for ye knyghte in hys mayle,<br />
He cared no more for ye monke with hys boke,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Than the fyendis in depe Croix Dale.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It will be seen by the last line in this verse that the author
was evidently prepared to back the devil and all his works
against anything the Church could do.&nbsp; But that is a
detail.&nbsp; The wild boar was eventually slain by Hodge of the
Ferry, who ended him by the not very heroic process of digging a
deep pit in the course of his usual path, and when the animal
fell in, cutting his head off, doubtless from a safe point of
vantage above.&nbsp; Divested of legendary trappings, we can
readily picture the facts: the redoubtable Hodge hiding in the
nearest and tallest tree until the wild boar came along and fell
into the hole, when the champion descended and despatched him in
safety.&nbsp; <a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>The traditional scene of this exploit is half a mile to
the east of Ferryhill, at a farmstead called Cleve&rsquo;s
Cross.</p>
<p>Croixdale, or, as modern times have vulgarised its name,
Croxdale, lies on our way to Durham, past the hills of High and
Low Butcher Race.&nbsp; Now a shabby roadside village, with a
railway station of that name on the main line of the North
Eastern Railway, this neighbourhood has also had its
romance.&nbsp; The road descends steeply to the river Wear, and
in the vicinity is the dark hollow which medi&aelig;val
superstition peopled with evil spirits, the &ldquo;fyendis&rdquo;
who, as the ballad says, cared nothing for the monk with his
book.&nbsp; To evict these hardy sprites a cross was erected,
hence &ldquo;Croixdale&rdquo;; but with what result is not
stated.</p>

<p>The cross roads here, too, have their story, for Andrew Tate,
a highwayman, convicted of murdering and robbing seven persons
near Sunderland Bridge, was hanged where they branch off, in
1602, and afterwards buried beneath the gallows.&nbsp; Now that
no devils or highwaymen haunt the lovely woodland borders of the
Wear at this spot, it is safe to linger by Sunderland Bridge,
just below Croxdale, where the exceedingly picturesque old stone
bridge of four arches carries the <a name="page116"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 116</span>road over the river.&nbsp; Perhaps
the distant railway viaduct may spoil the sylvan solitude of the
place, but, on the other hand, it may help to emphasise it.&nbsp;
Across that viaduct rush and roar the expresses to and from
London and the North; while the fisherman plys his contemplative
craft from the sandy beaches below the bridge.&nbsp; Many a
wearied coach passenger, passing this spot in the old days on
summer evenings, must have longingly drunk in the beauty of the
scene.&nbsp; Other passengers by coach had a terrible experience
here in 1822, when the mail was overturned on the bridge and two
passengers killed.</p>
<p>Thoresby, in his <i>Diary</i>, under date of May 1703,
describes one of his journeys with his usual inaccuracy as to the
incidence of places, and mentions Sunderland Bridge, together
with another, close by.&nbsp; This would be Browney Bridge, to
which we come in a quarter of a mile nearer Durham; only Thoresby
places it the other way, where, on the hillside, such a bridge
would be impossible.&nbsp; He mentions seeing the legend,
&ldquo;Sockeld&rsquo;s Leap, 1692,&rdquo; inscribed on one of the
coping-stones, and tells how two horsemen, racing on this road,
jumped on the bridge together with such force that one of them,
breaking down the battlements of the bridge, fell into the stream
below, neither he nor his horse having any injury.</p>
<p>Ascending the steep rise beyond Browney Bridge, Farewell Hall
on the left is passed, the place taking its name, according to
the commonly received story, from the Earl of Derwentwater
bidding farewell to his friends here when on his way, a captured
rebel, to London and the scaffold, in 1715.&nbsp; Climbing one
more ridge, the first view of Durham Cathedral is gained on
coming down the corresponding descent, a long straight run into
the outskirts of the city.&nbsp; Durham Cathedral appears,
majestic against the sky, long before any sign of the city itself
is noted; a huge bulk dominating the scene and dwarfing the
church of St. Oswald at the foot of the hill, itself no
inconsiderable building.&nbsp; To the right hand rises Nine Tree
Hill, with <a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>the nine trees that stand sponsors to it still weirdly
conspicuous on its crest, and down beneath it spread the grimy
and unkempt works of the Old Elvet Colliery.</p>

<h2>XXI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> traveller pursuing his
northward way comes into Durham by the back door, as it were, for
the suburb of Old Elvet through which the Great North Road
conducts to the ancient city is one of the least prepossessing of
entrances, and, besides being dirty and shabby, is endowed with a
cobble-stoned road which, as if its native unevenness were not
sufficient, may generally be found strewed with fragments of
hoop-iron, clinkers, and other puncturing substances calculated
to give tragical pauses to the exploring cyclist who essays to
follow the route whose story is set forth in these pages.&nbsp;
Old Elvet is in no sense a prepossessing suburb of Durham, but
its steep and stony street is a true exemplar of the city&rsquo;s
other highways and byways, which are nothing if not breakneck and
badly paved, as well as being badly kept.&nbsp; But facing Old
Elvet&rsquo;s long street is still to be found the &ldquo;Three
Tuns,&rdquo; where coach passengers in the closing years of that
era delighted to stay, and where, although the well-remembered
hostess of the inn has been gathered to Abraham&rsquo;s bosom,
the guest on entering is still served in his bedroom with the
welcoming glass of cherry-brandy which it has for the best part
of a century been the pleasing custom of the house to
present.&nbsp; No other such ambrosial cup as this, rare in
itself and hallowed by old memories, greets the wayfarer along
the roads nowadays.</p>
<p>From here, or other headquarters, let us set forth to explore
the city, planted on a craggy site looking down upon the
encompassing Wear that flows deep down between rocky banks
clothed thickly with woods.&nbsp; To enter the city proper from
&ldquo;Old Elvet,&rdquo; one must <a name="page119"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 119</span>needs cross Elvet Bridge, still
narrow, although the subject of a widening by which its width was
doubled in 1805.&nbsp; How the earlier coaches crossed it is
therefore something of a problem.</p>
<p>It has often been claimed for Durham that it is &ldquo;the
most picturesque city in England,&rdquo; and if by that
contention we are to understand the site of it to be meant, the
claim must be allowed.&nbsp; Cities are not so many that there is
much difficulty in estimating their comparative charms; and were
it even a question of towns, few might be found to have footholds
of such beauty.</p>
<p>The Wear and that rocky bluff which it renders all but an
island, seemed to the distracted monks of Lindisfarne, worn out
with a century&rsquo;s wandering over the north of England in
search of safety from the marauding heathen Danes who had laid
waste the coast and their island cathedral, an ideal spot; and so
to the harsh necessities of over nine hundred years ago we owe
both this selection of a site and the building upon it of a
cathedral which should be an outpost for the Lord in the
turbulent North and a castle for the protection of his
servants.&nbsp; It was in the year 995 that, after a hundred and
twenty years of constant wandering, the successors of those monks
who had fled from Lindisfarne with the body of their revered
bishop, the famous Saint Cuthbert, came here, still bearing his
hallowed remains.&nbsp; Their last journey had been from
Ripon.&nbsp; Coming near this spot, the Saint, who though by this
time dead for over three hundred years, was as masterful as he
had been in life, manifested his approval of the neighbourhood by
refusing to be carried any further.&nbsp; When the peripatetic
bishop and monks found that his coffin remained immovable they
fasted and prayed for three days, after which disciplinary
exercise, one of their number had a vision wherein it was
revealed to him that the Saint should be carried to Dunholme,
where he was to be received into a place of rest.&nbsp; So,
setting forth again, distressed in mind by not knowing where
Dunholme lay, but hoping for a <a name="page120"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 120</span>supernatural guidance, they came
presently to &ldquo;a place surrounded with rocks, where there
was a river of rapid waves and fishes of various kinds mingling
with the floods.&nbsp; Great forests grew there, and in deep
valleys were wild animals of many sorts, and deer
innumerable.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was when they were come to this
romantic place that they heard a milkmaid calling to her
companion, and asking where her cow was.&nbsp; The answer, that
&ldquo;she was in Dunholme&rdquo; was &ldquo;an happy and
heavenly sound to the distressed monks, who thereby had
intelligence that their journey&rsquo;s end was at hand, and the
Saint&rsquo;s body near its resting-place.&rdquo;&nbsp; Pressing
onward, they found the cow in Dunholme, and here, on the site of
the present Cathedral, they raised their first &ldquo;little
Church of Wands and Branches.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Cathedral and the
Castle that they and their immediate successors raised have long
since been replaced; but the great Norman piles of rugged fame
and stern battlemented and loopholed fortress crowning the same
rocky heights prove that those who kept the Church anchored here
had need to watch as well as pray, to fight secular battles as
well as wage war against the devil and all his works.&nbsp; It
was this double necessity that made the bishops of Durham until
our own time bishops-palatine; princes of the State as well as of
the Church, and in the old days men of the sword as well as of
the pastoral staff; and their cathedral shadows forth these
conditions of their being in no uncertain way.&nbsp; There is no
finer pile of Norman masonry in this country than this great
edifice, whose central tower and east end are practically the
only portions not in that style, and of these that grand and
massive tower, although of the Perpendicular period, is akin to
the earlier parts in feeling; nor is there another quite so
impressive a tower in England as this, either for itself or in
its situation, with the sole exception of &ldquo;Boston
Stump,&rdquo; that beacon raised against the sky for many miles
across the Lincolnshire levels.</p>

</a></p>
<p>Woods and river still surround the Cathedral, as Turner shows
in his exquisite view from the Prebend&rsquo;s <a
name="page123"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 123</span>Bridge, one
among many other glorious and unexpected glimpses which the
rugged nature of Durham&rsquo;s site provides from all points,
but incomparably the best of all.&nbsp; It is here that, most
appropriately, there has been placed a decorative tablet, carved
in oak, and bearing the quotation from Sir Walter Scott,
beginning&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Half House of God, half Castle; &rsquo;gainst the
Scot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>a quotation that gains additional point from the circumstance
of the battle of Neville&rsquo;s Cross having been fought against
the invading Scots, October 17th, 1346, within sight from the
Cathedral roofs.&nbsp; This view is one of Turner&rsquo;s
infrequent topographically accurate works.&nbsp; Perhaps even he
felt the impossibility of improving upon the beauty of the
scene.</p>
<p>Still, annually, after evensong on May 29th, the lay clerks
and choristers of the Cathedral ascend to the roof of the great
central tower, in their cassocks and surplices, and sing
anthems.&nbsp; The first, Farrant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Lord, for Thy
tender mercies&rsquo; sake,&rdquo; is a reference to the national
crime of the execution of Charles the First, and is sung facing
south.&nbsp; The second, &ldquo;Therefore with angels and
archangels,&rdquo; by V. Novello, expressing the pious sentiment
that the martyred king shall rest in Paradise, in company with
those bright beings, is sung facing east; and the third,
&ldquo;Give Peace in our time, O Lord,&rdquo; by W. H. Callcott,
facing north.</p>
<p>The origin of this observance was the thanksgiving for the
victory of Neville&rsquo;s Cross, a famous and a complete
success, when fifteen thousand Scots were slain and David the
Second, the Scottish king and many of his nobles, captured.&nbsp;
It was to the special intervention of St. Cuthbert, whose sacred
banner was carried by Prior John Fossor to Maiden Bower, a spot
overlooking the battlefield, that this signal destruction of the
enemy was ascribed.&nbsp; The Prior prayed beside it, but his
monks are said to have offered up their petitions from the more
distant, and safer, vantage-point of the Cathedral towers.&nbsp;
Perhaps they had a turn of <a name="page124"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 124</span>agnosticism in their minds; but, at
any rate, they took no risks.</p>
<p>The original tower-top <i>Te Deum</i> afterwards sung on the
anniversary seems to have been discontinued at the
Reformation.&nbsp; The revival came after the King&rsquo;s
Restoration in 1660, when the day was altered to May 29th, to
give the celebration the character of a rejoicing at the return
of Charles the Second.&nbsp; This revival itself fell into disuse
in the eighteenth century, being again restored in 1828, and
continued ever since.</p>
<p>The battlefield of Neville&rsquo;s Cross lies to the west of
the Cathedral, so no singing takes place on the western side of
the tower.&nbsp; The popular, but mistaken, idea in Durham is
that this is because a choir-boy once overbalanced on that side
and fell from the tower.</p>
<p>If you would see how Castle and Cathedral are situated with
regard to the busy modern city, there is no such place as the
railway station, whence they are seen dominating the mass of
houses, among the smoke-wreaths of commerce, like the martyrs of
old steadfast amidst their burning faggots.&nbsp; If again,
reversing the order of precedence as seen in the view from
Prebend&rsquo;s Bridge, you would have the Castle in the
forefront and the Cathedral behind, it is from the Framwellgate
Bridge, carrying the Great North Road over the Wear, that another
lovely glimpse is seen, ranging to Prebend&rsquo;s Bridge
itself.</p>
<h2>XXII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">But</span> time grows short, and we have
not long to linger at Durham.&nbsp; Much else might be said of
the Cathedral; of Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s Shrine, and of the
vandal Wyatt, who &ldquo;restored&rdquo; the Cathedral in 1775,
cutting away, in the process, a depth of four inches from the
stonework of much of the exterior.&nbsp; The work cost
&pound;30,000, and resulted in eleven hundred tons weight of
stone chippings being removed from the building.&nbsp; If that <a
name="page126"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
126</span>&ldquo;restorer&rdquo; had had his way, he would have
destroyed the beautiful Galilee Chapel that projects from the
west front, and forms so uniquely interesting a feature of Late
Norman work.&nbsp; His idea was to drive a carriage road round
this way.&nbsp; The work of destruction had, indeed, already been
begun when it was stopped by more reverent men.</p>

<img alt=

"The Sanctuary Knocker"
 src="images/p125.jpg" />
</a></p>
<p>A curious relic still remains upon the door of the
Cathedral&rsquo;s north porch, in the form of a huge knocker,
dating back to Norman times.&nbsp; Cast in the shape of a
grinning monster&rsquo;s head, a ring hanging from its jaws, it
is the identical sanctuary knocker of Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s
Sanctuary, which was in use from the foundation of the Cathedral
until 1524.&nbsp; All fugitives, whatever their crimes, who
succeeded in escaping to Durham, and reaching the bounds of
&ldquo;Saint Cuthbert&rsquo;s Peace,&rdquo; were safe from
molestation during thirty-seven days.&nbsp; A criminal, grasping
the ring of this knocker, could not be torn from it by his
pursuers, under pain of their being subjected to excommunication;
and lest there should be bold spirits whom even this could not
affright, there were always two monks stationed, day and night,
in a room above the porch, to watch for fugitives.&nbsp; When
admitted, the criminal confessed his crime, with every
circumstance attending it, his confession being taken down in
writing, in the presence of witnesses; a bell ringing in the
Galilee tower all the while, giving notice that some one had fled
to the protection of Saint Cuthbert.&nbsp; After these
formalities, the fugitive was clothed with a black gown, bearing
a yellow cross on the left shoulder: the badge of the Saint whose
protection he had secured.&nbsp; After the days of grace had
expired, and in the event of no pardon being obtained, ceremonies
were gone through before the Shrine, in which the malefactor
solemnly forswore his native land for ever.&nbsp; Then,
safeguarded to the coast, he was shipped out of the kingdom by
the first vessel sailing after his arrival.</p>

</a></p>
<p>There must have been many an exciting chase along the roads in
those times, and many a criminal who richly <a
name="page129"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 129</span>deserved
punishment must have escaped it by the very skin of his
teeth.&nbsp; Many another, no doubt, was seized and handed over
to justice, or slain, on the threshold of safety.&nbsp; Other
fugitives still&mdash;and here Saint Cuthbert appears in better
guise&mdash;victims of hatred and oppression, private or
political, claimed the saintly &aelig;gis, and so escaped the
vengeance of their enemies.&nbsp; So, looking upon the
ferociously grinning mask of the knocker, glaring with eyeless
sockets upon Palace Green, we can reconstruct the olden times
when, at his last gasp, the flying wretch seized the ring and so
came into safety.&nbsp; By night, the scene was more impressive
still, for there were crystals in those sockets then, and a lamp
burning behind, so that the fugitive could see his haven from
afar, and make for it.</p>
<p>To-day, Saint Cuthbert avails no man, as the county gaol and
the assize courts sufficiently prove, and Durham city is
essentially modern, from the coal-grit that powders its dirty
streets to the awfully grotesque effigy of a Marquis of
Londonderry that lends so diabolical an air to the Market-place,
where the Statute Fair is held, and where he sits, a coal-black
effigy across his coal-black horse, towering over the steam
merry-go-rounds, like Satan amid the revelries of a Walpurgis
Night.&nbsp; This bronze effigy is probably the most grotesque
statue in the British Isles, and loses nothing of that quality in
the noble Marquis being represented in a hussar uniform with
flying dolman over his shoulders, and a busby, many sizes too
large for him, on his head, in an attitude as though ferociously
inviting the houses on the other side of the street to
&ldquo;come on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That diarising Scotswoman, Mrs. Calderwood of Coltness,
travelling south in 1756, wrote:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We dined at Durhame, and I went to see the cathedrall;
it is a prodigious bulky building.&nbsp; It was on Sunday betwixt
services, and in the piazzas there were several boys playing at
ball.&nbsp; I asked the girl that attended me, if it was the
custome for the boys to play at ball on Sunday: she said,
&lsquo;they play on other <a name="page130"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 130</span>days, as well as on
Sundays.&rsquo;&nbsp; She called her mother to show me the
Church; and I suppose, by my questions, the woman took me for a
heathen, as I found she did not know of any other mode of worship
but her own; so, that she might not think the Bishop&rsquo;s
chair defiled by my sitting down in it, I told her I was a
Christian, though the way of worship in my country differed from
hers.&nbsp; In particular, she stared when I asked what the
things were that they kneeled upon, as they appeared to me to be
so many Cheshire cheeses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were hassocks: articles apparently then not known to
Presbyterians.</p>
<p>And so she continued southward:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next day, the 7th, we dined none, but baited at
different places, and betwixt Doncaster and Bautry a man rode
about in an odd way, whom we suspected for a highwayman.&nbsp;
Upon his coming near, John Rattray pretended to make a quarle
with the post boy, and let him know that he keept good powder and
ball to keep such folks as him in order; upon which the felow
scampered off cross the common.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Great North Road leaves Durham over <a
name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
131</span>Framwellgate Bridge, built by Bishop Flambard in Norman
times.&nbsp; Although altered and repaired in the fifteenth
century and later, it is still substantially the same
bridge.&nbsp; There was once a fortified gateway on it, but that
was taken down in 1760.&nbsp; Bridge, River, Castle, and
Cathedral here form a majestic picture.</p>
<h2>XXIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">And</span> now to take the open road
again.&nbsp; The chief features of the road between Durham and
Newcastle are coal-pits, dismal pit villages, and
coal-dust.&nbsp; Not at once, however, is the traveller
introduced to these, and the ascent out of Durham, through the
wooded banks of Dryburn, is very pretty.&nbsp; It is at
Framwellgate Moor, a mile and a half from the city, that the
presence of coal begins to make itself felt, in the rows of
unlovely cottages, and in the odd figures of the pitmen, who may
be seen returning from their work, with grimy faces and
characteristic miner&rsquo;s dress.&nbsp; Adjoining this village,
and indistinguishable from it by the stranger, is the roadside
collection of cottages known as &ldquo;Pity Me,&rdquo; taking its
name from the hunted fox in the sign of the &ldquo;Lambton
Hounds&rdquo; inn.</p>
<p>Framwellgate is scarce left behind before there rises up in
the far distance, on the summit of one of the many hills to the
north-east, a hill-top temple resembling the Athenian Acropolis,
and as you go northward it is the constant companion of your
journey for some seven or eight miles.&nbsp; This is
&ldquo;Penshaw Monument,&rdquo; erected on that windy height in
1844, four years after his death, to the memory of John George
Lambton, first Earl of Durham.&nbsp; It cost &pound;6,000, and
commemorates the championship of the Reform movement in its
earlier and precarious days by that statesman.&nbsp; Like many
another monument, impressive at a distance, a near approach to it
leads to disillusion, for its classic outlines are allied to
coarse workmanship, and its eighteen great <a
name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 132</span>columns are
hollow.&nbsp; Penshaw, deriving its name from Celtic words,
signifying a wooded height, still has its woodlands to justify
the name given nearly a thousand years ago.</p>

<p>The little town of Chester-le-Street lies three miles ahead,
past the few cottages of Plawsworth, once the site of a
turnpike-gate, and by Chester Moor and the pretty wooded hollow
of Chester Dene, where the Con Burn goes rippling through the
undergrowth to join the river Wear, and a bridge carries the
highway across the gap.&nbsp; Approaching Chester-le-Street, the
bright yellow sandstone mass of Lumley Castle, the ancient seat
of the Earl of Scarborough, is prominent in the valley to the
right, while beyond it rise the woods of Lambton Castle, the Earl
of Durham&rsquo;s domain.&nbsp; The neighbourhood of
Chester-le-Street yet preserves the weird legend of the
&ldquo;Lambton Worm,&rdquo; and Worm Hill is still pointed out as
the home of that fabulous monster who laid the country under
contribution for the satisfying of his voracious appetite, and
was kept in good humour by being provided with the milk of nine
cows daily.&nbsp; Many had essayed to slay the serpent and had
fallen victims instead, until the heir of Lambton, returned from
the red fields and hair&rsquo;s-breadth escapes of foreign wars,
set forth to free the countryside from the terror.&nbsp; But
before he started, he was warned (so the legend runs), that
unless <a name="page133"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
133</span>he vowed, being successful in his enterprise, to slay
the first living thing he met on his return, the lords of Lambton
would never, for nine generations to come, die in their
beds.&nbsp; He took that vow, and, armed with his trusty sword
and a suit of armour made of razor-blades, met and slew the Worm,
who coiled himself round the knight in order to crush him as he
had the others, and so was cut in pieces against the keen
edges.&nbsp; But the victor on returning was met by his father,
instead of by the favourite dog who had been destined for the
sacrifice.&nbsp; The sword dropped from his nerveless hand, and
he broke the vow.&nbsp; What mattered it where the future
generations died; in their beds, or, as warriors might wish, in
their boots?</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, the next nine heirs of Lambton did die
more or less violent deaths; a circumstance which is pointed to
in proof of the legend&rsquo;s truth.&nbsp; If other proof be
wanting, one has only to visit Lambton Castle, where the
identical trough from which the Worm drank his daily allowance of
milk is still shown the curious tourist!</p>
<p>Chester-le-Street bears little in its appearance to hint at
its great age and interesting history.&nbsp; A very up-to-date
little town, whose prosperity derives from its position as a
marketing centre for the surrounding pitmen, it supports
excellent shops and rejoices in the possession of Co-operative
Societies, whose objects are to provide their subscribers with
whatever they want at cost price, and to starve the trader, who
trades for profit, out of existence.&nbsp; That shops and
societies exist side by side, and that both look prosperous,
seems remarkable, not to say miraculous.&nbsp; Let the
explanation of these things be left to other hands.</p>
<p>The name of Chester-le-Street doubly reveals the Roman origin
of the place from the castle on the road which existed here in
those distant times, and has easily survived the name of
Cunecaster, which the Saxons gave it.&nbsp; At Cunecaster the
ancient bishopric of Bernicia, forerunner of the present See of
Durham, had its cathedral for a hundred and thirteen years, <a
name="page134"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 134</span>from <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 882 to 995; having been removed from
the Farne Islands on the approach of the heathen Danes, the monks
carrying the coffin of their sainted bishop, St. Cuthbert, with
them on their wanderings.&nbsp; The dedication of the present
church to Saints Mary and Cuthbert is a relic of that time, but
the building itself is not older than the thirteenth
century.&nbsp; It preserves an ancient anchorites&rsquo;
cell.</p>
<p>The finest surviving anchorage in England is this of
Chester-le-Street.&nbsp; It is built against the north wall of
the tower, and is of two storeys with two rooms on each.&nbsp;
Two &ldquo;low-side&rdquo; windows communicating with the
churchyard remain, and a smaller opening into the church is close
by.&nbsp; Through this, food and offerings were passed to the
anchorite, together with the keys of the church treasure-chest,
left in his custody by the clergy.&nbsp; From this orifice the
holy hermit could obtain a view all over the building, and an odd
hagioscope or &ldquo;squint,&rdquo; pierced through one of the
pillars, allowed of his seeing the celebration of Mass at a
side-chapel, in addition to that at the High Altar.&nbsp; This
was no damp and inconvenient hermitage, for when the anchorite
was kicked out at the Reformation, and bidden go and earn an
honest living, his old home was let to three widows.&nbsp;
Eventually, in 1619, the curate found the place so
desirable&mdash;or, as a house-agent would say, so
&ldquo;eligible&rdquo;&mdash;that he took up his abode there.</p>
<p>The church also contains fourteen monumental effigies
ascribed, without much truth in the ascription, to the
Lumleys.&nbsp; John, Lord Lumley, collected them from ruined
abbeys and monasteries in the neighbourhood some three hundred
years ago, and called them ancestors.&nbsp; He was technically
right; for we all descend from Adam, but not quite so right when,
finding he could not steal a sufficient number of these
&ldquo;ancestors,&rdquo; he commissioned the local masons to
rough-hew him out a few more.&nbsp; They are here to this day,
and an ill-favoured gang they look, too.</p>
<p>The town of Chester-le-Street found little favour <a
name="page135"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 135</span>with De
Foe, who, passing through it, found the place &ldquo;an old dirty
thoroughfare town.&rdquo;&nbsp; The modern traveller cannot say
the same, but it is possible that if he happened to pass through
on Shrove Tuesday, he would describe the inhabitants as savages;
for on that day the place is given up to a game of football
played in the streets, the town taking sides, and when the ball
is not within reach, kicking one another.&nbsp; With a proper
respect for their shop fronts, the trades-folk all close on this
day.</p>
<p>The three miles between Chester-le-Street and Birtley afford a
wide-spreading panorama of the Durham coal-field.&nbsp; Pretty
country before its mineral wealth began to be developed, its
hills and dales reveal chimney-shafts and hoisting-gear in every
direction, and smoke-wreaths, blown across country by the raging
winds of the north, blacken everything.&nbsp; Birtley is a
typical pit village and its approaches characteristic of the coal
country.&nbsp; The paths are black, the hedges and trees ragged
and sooty, and tramways from the collieries cross the road
itself, unfenced, the trucks dropping coal in the highway.&nbsp;
One coal village is as like another as are two peas.&nbsp; They
are all frankly unornamental; all face the road on either side,
each cottage the exact replica of its unlovely neighbour, and the
footpaths are almost invariably unpaved.&nbsp; These are the
homes of the &ldquo;Geordies,&rdquo; as the pitmen once were
invariably called.&nbsp; They were rough in their ways, but very
different from the more recent sort: the trade-unionist miner:
the better educated but more discontented and unlovable
man.&nbsp; But &ldquo;Geordie,&rdquo; the old-type typical
pitman, was not a bad fellow, by any means.&nbsp; If any man
worked, literally, by the sweat of his brow, it was he, in his
eight hours&rsquo; shift down in the stifling tunnels of the
coal-mine.&nbsp; He earned a high wage and deserved a higher, for
he carried his life in his hand, and any day that witnessed his
descent half a mile or so into the black depths of the pit might
also have seen an accident which, by the fall of a roof of coal,
by fire or flood, explosion, or the unseen but <a
name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 136</span>deadly
choke-damp, should end his existence, and that of hundreds like
him.</p>
<p>The midday aspect of a coal village is singularly quiet and
empty.&nbsp; Scarce a man or boy is to be seen.&nbsp; Half of
them are at work down below, in the first day shift to which they
went at an early hour of the morning: and those of the night, who
came up when the others descended, are enjoying a well-earned
repose.&nbsp; A coal-miner just come to bank from his
coal-hewing, looks anything but the respectable fellow he
generally is, nowadays.&nbsp; With his peaked leathern cap, thick
short coat, woollen muffler, limp knickerbockers, blue worsted
stockings, heavy lace-up boots and dirty face, he looks like a
half-bleached nigger football-player.&nbsp; When washed, his is a
pallid countenance which the stranger, unused to the colourless
faces of those who work underground, might be excused for
thinking that of one recovering from an illness.&nbsp; And
washing is a serious business with &ldquo;Geordie.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Every pitman&rsquo;s cottage has its tub wherein he
&ldquo;cleans&rdquo; himself, as he expresses it, while the
women-folk crowd the street.&nbsp; What the cottages lack in
accommodation they make up for in cleanliness and display.&nbsp;
The pitman&rsquo;s wife wages an heroic and never-ending war
against dirt and grime, and both have an astonishing love of
finery and bright colours which reveals itself even down to the
door-step, coloured a brilliant red, yellow, or blue, according
to individual taste.&nbsp; Nowadays football claims
&ldquo;Geordie&rsquo;s&rdquo; affections before anything
else.&nbsp; That rowdy game, more than any other, serves to work
off any superfluous energy, and there are stories, more or less
true, which tell of pitmen, tired of waiting for &ldquo;t&rsquo;
ball,&rdquo; starting &ldquo;t&rsquo; gaame&rdquo; by kicking one
another instead!&nbsp; Coursing, dog-fancying, and the breeding
of canaries are other favourite pitmen&rsquo;s pastimes, and they
dearly love a garden.&nbsp; Where an outdoor garden is
impossible, a window garden is a favourite resource, and even the
ugliest cottages take on a certain smartness when to the yellow
doorstep are added bright green window-shutters and a window full
of scarlet <a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>geraniums.&nbsp; Very many pitmen are musical.&nbsp; We
do not in this connection refer to the inevitable American organ
whose doleful wails wring your very heart-strings as you pass the
open cottage doors on Sunday afternoons, but to the really expert
violinists often found in the pit villages.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> Harlowgreen Lane, where a little
wayside inn, the &ldquo;Coach and Horses,&rdquo; stands beside a
wooded dingle, we have the only pleasant spot before reaching
Gateshead.&nbsp; Prettily rural, with an old-world air which no
doubt gains an additional beauty after the ugliness of Birtley,
it looks like one of those roadside scenes pencilled so deftly by
Rowlandson, and might well have been one of the roadside
stopping-places mentioned in that book so eloquent of the Great
North Road, Smollett&rsquo;s <i>Roderick Random</i>.&nbsp; No
other work gives us so fine a description of old road travel,
partly founded, no doubt, upon the author&rsquo;s&rsquo; own <a
name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 139</span>observation
of the wayfaring life of his time.&nbsp; Smollett himself
travelled from Glasgow to Edinburgh and London in 1739, and in
the character of Roderick he narrates some of his own
adventures.&nbsp; For a good part of the way Roderick found
neither coach, cart, nor wagon on the road, and so journeyed with
a train of pack-carriers so far as Newcastle, sitting on one of
the horses&rsquo; pack-saddles.&nbsp; At Newcastle he met Strap,
the barber&rsquo;s assistant, and they journeyed to London
together, sometimes afoot; at other times by stage-wagon, a
method of travelling which, practised by those of small means,
was a commonplace of the period at which Smollett wrote.&nbsp; It
was a method which had not changed in the least since the days of
James the First, and was to continue even into the first years of
the nineteenth century.&nbsp; Fynes Morrison, who wrote an
<i>Itinerary</i>&mdash;and an appallingly dull work it
is&mdash;in the reign of the British Solomon, talks of them as
&ldquo;long covered wagons, carrying passengers from place to
place; but this kind of journeying is so tedious, by reason they
must take wagon very early and come very late to their innes,
that none but women and people of inferior condition travel in
this sort.&rdquo;&nbsp; Hogarth pictured these lumbering
conveyances, which at their best performed fifteen miles a day,
and Rowlandson and many other artists have employed their pencils
upon them.</p>

<p>Smollett is an eighteenth-century robust humorist, whose works
are somewhat strong meat for our times; but he is a classic, and
his works (unlike the usual run of &ldquo;classics,&rdquo; which
are aptly said to be books which no one ever reads) have, each
one, enough humour to furnish half a dozen modern authors, and
are proof against age and change of taste.&nbsp; To the student
of bygone times and manners, <i>Roderick Random</i> affords (oh!
rare conjunction) both instruction and amusement.&nbsp; It is, of
course, a work of fiction, but fiction based on personal
experience, and palpitating with the life of the times in which
it was written.&nbsp; It thus affords a splendid view of this
great road about 1739, and of the <a name="page140"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 140</span>way in which the thrifty Scots
youths then commonly came up to town.</p>
<p>Their first night&rsquo;s halt was at a hedgerow alehouse,
half a mile from the road, to which came also a pedlar.&nbsp; The
pedlar, for safety&rsquo;s sake, screwed up the door of the
bedroom in which they all slept.&nbsp; &ldquo;I slept very
sound,&rdquo; says Roderick, &ldquo;until midnight, when I was
disturbed by a violent motion of the bed, which shook under me
with a continual tremor.&nbsp; Alarmed at this phenomenon, I
jogged my companion, whom, to my amazement, I found drenched in
sweat, and quaking through every limb; he told me, with a low,
faltering voice, that we were undone, for there was a bloody
highwayman with loaded pistols in the next room; then, bidding me
make as little noise as possible, he directed me to a small chink
in the board partition, through which I could see a thick-set,
brawny fellow, with a fierce countenance, sitting at a table with
our young landlady, having a bottle of ale and a brace of pistols
before him.&rdquo;&nbsp; The highwayman was cursing his luck
because a confederate, a coachman, had given intelligence of a
rich coach-load to some other plunderer, who had gone off with
&pound;400 in cash, together with jewels and money.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But did you find nothing worth taking which escaped the
other gentleman of the road?&rdquo; asked the landlady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not much,&rdquo; he replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I gleaned a
few things, such as a pair of pops, silver-mounted (here they
are); I took them, loaded, from the charge of the captain who had
charge of the money the other fellow had taken, together with a
gold watch which he had concealed in his breeches.&nbsp; I
likewise found ten Portugal pieces in the shoes of a Quaker, whom
the spirit moved to revile me, with great bitterness and
devotion; but what I value myself mostly for is this here
purchase, a gold snuff-box, my girl, with a picture on the inside
of the lid, which I untied out of the tail of a pretty
lady&rsquo;s smock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the pedlar began to snore so loudly that <a
name="page141"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 141</span>the
highwayman heard him through the partition.&nbsp; Alarmed, he
asked the landlady who was there, and when she told him,
travellers, replied, &ldquo;Spies! you jade!&nbsp; But no matter,
I&rsquo;ll send them all to hell in an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The landlady pacified him by saying that they were only three
poor Scotchmen; but Strap by this time was under the bed.</p>
<p>The night was one of alarms.&nbsp; Roderick and Strap awakened
the pedlar, who, thinking the best course was not to wait for the
doubtful chance of being alive to see the morning dawn, vanished
with his pack through the window.</p>
<p>After having paid their score in the morning, the two set out
again.&nbsp; They had not gone more than five miles before a man
on horseback overtook them, whom they recognised as Mr. Rifle,
the highwayman of the night before.&nbsp; He asked them if they
knew who he was.&nbsp; Strap fell on his knees in the road.&nbsp;
&ldquo;For heaven&rsquo;s sake, Mr. Rifle,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;have mercy on us, we know you very well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho!&rdquo; cried the thief, &ldquo;you do!&nbsp; But
you shall never be evidence against me in this world, you
dog!&rdquo; and so saying, he drew a pistol and fired at the
unfortunate shaver, who fell flat on the ground, without a
word.&nbsp; He then turned upon Roderick, but the sound of
horses&rsquo; hoofs was heard, and a party of travellers galloped
up, leaving the highwayman barely time to ride off.&nbsp; One of
them was the captain who had been robbed the day before.&nbsp; He
was not, as may already have been gathered, a valiant man.&nbsp;
He turned pale at the sight of Strap.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s murder
committed; let us alight.&rdquo;&nbsp; The others were for
pursuing the highwayman, and the captain only escaped
accompanying them by making his horse rear and snort, and
pretending the animal was frightened.&nbsp; Fortunately, Strap
&ldquo;had received no other wound than what his fear had
inflicted&rdquo;; and after having been bled at an inn half a
mile away, they were about to resume their journey, when a
shouting <a name="page142"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
142</span>crowd came down the road, with the highwayman in the
midst, riding horseback with his hands tied behind him.&nbsp; He
was being escorted to the nearest Justice of the Peace.&nbsp;
Halting a while for refreshment, they dismounted Mr. Rifle and
mounted guard, a circle of peasants armed with pitchforks round
him.&nbsp; When they at length reached the magistrate&rsquo;s
house, they found he was away for the night, and so locked their
prisoner in a garret, from which, of course, he escaped.</p>
<p>Roderick and Strap were now free from being detained as
evidence.&nbsp; For two days they walked on, staying on the
second night in a public-house of a very sorry appearance in a
small village.&nbsp; At their entrance, the landlord, who seemed
a venerable old man, with long grey hair, rose from a table
placed by a large fire in a neat paved kitchen, and, with a
cheerful countenance, accosted them with the words:
&ldquo;<i>Salvete</i>, <i>pueri</i>;
<i>ingredimini</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was astonishing to hear a
rustic landlord talking Latin, but Roderick, concealing his
amazement, replied, &ldquo;<i>Dissolve frigus</i>, <i>ligna super
foco large reponens</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had no sooner pronounced
the words than the innkeeper, running towards him, shook him by
the hands, crying, &ldquo;<i>Fili mi dilectissime</i>! <i>unde
venis</i>?&mdash;<i>a superis</i>, <i>ni fallor</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp;
In short, finding them both read in the classics, he did not know
how to testify his regard sufficiently; but ordered his daughter,
a jolly, rosy-checked damsel, who was his sole domestic, to bring
a bottle of his <i>quadrimum</i>; repeating at the same time from
Horace, &ldquo;<i>Deprome quadrimum Sabin&acirc;</i>, <i>O
Thaliarche</i>, <i>merum diota</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
excellent ale of his own brewing, of which he told them he had
always an <i>amphora</i>, four years old, for the use of himself
and friends.</p>
<p>The innkeeper proved to be a schoolmaster who was obliged, by
his income being so small, to supplement it by turning licensed
victualler.&nbsp; He was very inquisitive about their affairs,
and, while dinner was preparing, his talk abounded both with
Latin tags and with good advice to the inexperienced against the
deceits and wickedness of the world.&nbsp; They fared sumptuously
on <a name="page143"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 143</span>roast
fowl and several bottles of quadrimum, going to bed
congratulating themselves on the landlord&rsquo;s
good-humour.&nbsp; Strap was of opinion that they would be
charged nothing for their lodging and entertainment.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you observe,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;that he
has conceived a particular affection for us; nay, even treated us
with extraordinary fare, which, to be sure, we should not of
ourselves have called for?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roderick was not so sanguine.&nbsp; Rising early in the
morning, and having breakfasted with their host and his daughter
on hasty-pudding and ale, they desired to know what there was to
pay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Biddy will let you know, gentlemen,&rdquo; said the old
rascal of a tapster, &ldquo;for I never mind these matters.&nbsp;
Money-matters are beneath the concern of one who lives on the
Horatian plan: <i>Crescentem sequitur cura
pecuniam</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Biddy, having consulted a slate that hung in a
corner, gave the reckoning as eight shillings and sevenpence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Eight shillings and sevenpence!&rdquo; cried Strap;
&ldquo;&rsquo;tis impossible!&nbsp; You must be mistaken, young
woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Reckon again, child,&rdquo; said the father very
deliberately; &ldquo;perhaps you have miscounted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed, father,&rdquo; replied she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
know my business better.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Roderick demanded to know the particulars, on which the old
man got up, muttering, &ldquo;Ay, ay, let us see the particulars:
that&rsquo;s but reasonable&rdquo;; and, taking pen, ink, and
paper, wrote:</p>

<p>As he had not the appearance of a common publican, Roderick
could not upbraid him as he deserved, simply <a
name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 144</span>remarking
that he was sure he had not learned from Horace to be an
extortioner.&nbsp; To which the landlord replied that his only
aim was to live <i>contentus parvo</i>, and keep off <i>importuna
pauperies</i>.</p>
<p>Strap was indignant.&nbsp; He swore their host should either
take one-third or go without; but Roderick, seeing the daughter
go out and return with two stout fellows, with whom to frighten
them, thought it politic to pay what was asked.</p>
<p>It was a doleful walk they had that day.&nbsp; In the evening
they overtook the wagon, and it is here, and in the following
scenes, that we get an excellent description of the cheap road
travel of that era.</p>
<p>Strap mounted first into the wagon, but retired, dismayed, at
a tremendous voice which issued from its depths, with the words,
&ldquo;Fire and fury! there shall no passengers come
here.&rdquo;&nbsp; These words came from Captain Weazel, one of
the most singular characters to be found in Smollett&rsquo;s
pages.</p>
<p>Joey, the wagoner, was not afraid of the captain, and called
out, with a sneer: &ldquo;Waunds, coptain, whay woan&rsquo;t you
soofer the poor wagoneer to make a penny?&nbsp; Coom, coom, young
man, get oop, get oop; never moind the coptain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood and thunder! where&rsquo;s my sword?&rdquo;
exclaimed the man of war, when the two eventually fell, rather
than climbed, into the wagon&rsquo;s dark recesses, and
incidentally on to his stomach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, my dear?&rdquo; asked a female
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The matter?&rdquo; replied the captain; &ldquo;my guts
are squeezed into a pancake by that Scotchman&rsquo;s
hump.&rdquo;&nbsp; The &ldquo;hump,&rdquo; by the way, was poor
Strap&rsquo;s knapsack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our own fault,&rdquo; resumed the feminine voice;
&ldquo;we may thank ourselves for all the inconveniences we meet
with.&nbsp; I thank God I never travelled so before.&nbsp; I am
sure, if my lady or Sir John were to know where we are, they
would not sleep this night <a name="page145"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 145</span>for vexation.&nbsp; I wish to God we
had written for the chariot; I know we shall never be
forgiven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, my dear,&rdquo; replied the captain,
&ldquo;it don&rsquo;t signify fretting now; we shall laugh it
over as a frolic; I hope you will not suffer in your
health.&nbsp; I shall make my lord very merry with our adventures

<p>The unsophisticated lads were greatly impressed by this
talk.&nbsp; Not so the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;Some people,&rdquo;
broke in another woman&rsquo;s voice, &ldquo;give themselves a
great many needless airs; better folks than any here have
travelled in wagons before now.&nbsp; Some of us have rode in
coaches and chariots, with three footmen behind them, without
making so much fuss about it.&nbsp; What then! we are now all on
a footing; therefore let us be sociable and merry.&nbsp; What do
you say, Isaac?&nbsp; Is not this a good motion, you doting
rogue?&nbsp; Speak, old Cent. per cent.!&nbsp; What desperate
debt are you <a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>thinking of?&nbsp; What mortgage are you
planning?&nbsp; Well, Isaac, positively you shall never gain my
favour till you turn over a new leaf, grow honest, and live like
a gentleman.&nbsp; In the meantime, give me a kiss, you old
fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The words, accompanied by hearty smack, enlivened the person
to whom they were addressed to such a degree, that he cried, in a
transport, though with a faltering voice: &ldquo;Ah, you baggage!
on my credit you are a waggish girl&mdash;he, he,
he!&rdquo;&nbsp; This laugh introduced a fit of coughing which
almost suffocated the poor usurer&mdash;for such they afterwards
found was the profession of their fellow-traveller.</p>
<p>At their stopping-place for the night they had their first
opportunity of viewing these passengers.&nbsp; First came a
brisk, airy girl, about twenty years of age, with a silver-laced
hat on her head instead of a cap, a blue stuff riding-suit,
trimmed with silver, very much tarnished, and a whip in her
hand.&nbsp; After her came, limping, an old man, with a worsted
night-cap buttoned under his chin and a broad-brimmed hat
slouched over it, an old rusty blue cloak tied about his neck,
under which appeared a brown surtout that covered a threadbare
coat and waistcoat, and a dirty flannel jacket.&nbsp; His eyes
were hollow, bleared, and gummy; his face shrivelled into a
thousand wrinkles, his gums destitute of teeth, his nose sharp
and drooping, his chin peaked and prominent, so that when he
mumped or spoke they approached one another like a pair of
nut-crackers; he supported himself on an ivory-headed cane, and
his whole figure was a just emblem of winter, famine, and
avarice.</p>
<p>The captain was disclosed as a little thin creature, about the
age of forty, with a long, withered visage very much resembling
that of a baboon.&nbsp; He wore his own hair in a queue that
reached to his rump, and on it a hat the size and cock of Antient
Pistol&rsquo;s.&nbsp; He was about five feet and three inches in
height, sixteen inches of which went to his face and long scraggy
neck; his thighs were about six inches in <a
name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 147</span>length; his
legs, resembling two spindles or drumsticks, two feet and a half;
and his body the remainder; so that, on the whole, he appeared
like a spider or grasshopper erect.&nbsp; His dress consisted of
a frock of bear-skin, the skirts about half a foot long, a hussar
waistcoat, scarlet breeches reaching half-way down his thighs,
worsted stockings rolled up almost to his groin, and shoes with
wooden heels at least two inches high; he carried a sword very
nearly as long as himself in one hand, and with the other
conducted his lady, who seemed to be a woman of his own age,
still retaining some remains of good looks, but so ridiculously
affected that any one who was not a novice in the world would
easily have perceived in her deplorable vanity the second-hand
airs of a lady&rsquo;s woman.</p>
<p>This ridiculous couple were Captain and Mrs. Weazel.&nbsp; The
travellers all assembled in the kitchen of the inn, where,
according to the custom of the time, such impecunious wayfarers
were entertained; but the captain desired a room for himself and
his wife, so that they might sup by themselves, instead of in
that communal fashion.&nbsp; The innkeeper, however, did not much
relish this, but would have given way to the demand, providing
the other passengers made no objection.&nbsp; Unhappily for the
captain&rsquo;s absurd dignity, the others <i>did</i> object;
Miss Jenny, the lady with the silver-trimmed hat, in particular,
observing that &ldquo;if Captain Weazel and his lady had a mind
to sup by themselves, they might wait until the others should
have done.&rdquo;&nbsp; At this hint the captain put on a martial
frown and looked very big, without speaking; while his
yoke-fellow, with a disdainful toss of her nose, muttered
something about &ldquo;creature!&rdquo; which Miss Jenny
overhearing, stepped up to her, saying, &ldquo;None of your
names, good Mrs. Abigail.&nbsp; Creature! quotha&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
assure you&mdash;no such creature as you, neither&mdash;no
quality-coupler.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here the captain interposed, with a
&ldquo;D&mdash;n me, madam, what do you mean by that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, who are you?&rdquo; replied Miss Jenny; &ldquo;who
made you a captain, you pitiful, trencher-scraping, <a
name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 148</span>pimping
curler?&nbsp; The army is come to a fine pass when such fellows
as you get commissions.&nbsp; What, I suppose you think I
don&rsquo;t know you?&nbsp; You and your helpmate are well met: a
cast-off mistress and a bald valet-de-chambre are well yoked
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blood and wounds!&rdquo; cried Weazel;
&ldquo;d&rsquo;ye question the honour of my wife, madam?&nbsp; No
man in England durst say so much&mdash;I would flay him,
carbonado him!&nbsp; Fury and destruction!&nbsp; I would have his
liver for my supper!&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he drew his sword
and flourished it, to the great terror of Strap; while Miss
Jenny, snapping her fingers, told him she did not value his
resentment that!</p>
<p>We will pass over the Rabelaisian adventures of the night,
which, amusing enough, are too robust for these pages; and will
proceed to the next day&rsquo;s journey.&nbsp; Before they
started, Weazel had proved himself the arrant coward and braggart
which the reader has already perceived him to be; but,
notwithstanding this exposure, he entertained the company in the
wagon with accounts of his valour: how he had once knocked down a
soldier who had made game of him; had tweaked a drawer by the
nose who had found fault with his picking his teeth with a fork;
and had, moreover, challenged a cheesemonger who had had the
presumption to be his rival.</p>
<p>For five days they travelled in this manner.&nbsp; On the
sixth day, when they were about to sit down to dinner, the
innkeeper came and told them that three gentlemen, just arrived,
had ordered the meal to be sent to their apartment, although told
that it had been bespoken by the passengers in the
wagon,&mdash;to which information they had replied: &ldquo;The
passengers in the wagon might be d&mdash;d; their betters must be
served before them; they supposed it would be no hardship on such
travellers to dine on bread and cheese for one day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This was a great disappointment to them all, and they laid
their heads together to remedy it, Miss Jenny observing that
Captain Weazel, being a soldier by <a name="page149"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 149</span>profession, ought to protect
them.&nbsp; The captain adroitly excused himself by saying that
he would not, for all the world, be known to have travelled in a
wagon; swearing, at the same time, that, could he appear with
honour, they should eat his sword sooner than his
provision.&nbsp; On this declaration, Miss Jenny, snatching his
weapon, drew it and ran immediately into the kitchen, where she
threatened to put the cook to death if he did not immediately
send the victuals into their room.&nbsp; The noise she made
brought the three strangers down, one of whom no sooner perceived
her than he cried, &ldquo;Ha! Jenny Ramper! what brought thee
hither?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Jack Rattle,&rdquo; she replied, running into
his arms, &ldquo;is it you?&nbsp; Then Weazel may go whistle for
a dinner&mdash;I shall dine with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They consented with joy to this proposal; and the others were
on the point of being reduced to a very uncomfortable meal, when
Joey, the wagoner, understanding the whole affair, entered the
kitchen with a pitchfork in his hand, and swore he would be the
death of any man who should pretend to seize the victuals
prepared for the wagon.&nbsp; On this, the three strangers drew
their swords, and, being joined by their servants, bloodshed
seemed imminent; when the landlord, interposing, offered to part
with his own dinner, for the sake of peace; which proposal was
accepted and all ended happily.</p>
<p>When the journey was resumed in the afternoon, Roderick chose
to walk some distance beside the wagoner, a merry, good-natured
fellow, who informed him that Miss Jenny was a common girl of the
town, who, falling in company with a recruiting officer who had
carried her down in the stage-coach from London to Newcastle, was
obliged to return, as her companion was now in prison for
debt.&nbsp; Weazel had been a valet-de-chambre to my Lord Fizzle
while he lived separate from his lady; but on their
reconciliation she insisted on Weazel&rsquo;s being turned off,
as well as the woman who had lived with him: when his lordship,
<a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 150</span>to get
rid of them both with a good grace, proposed that Weazel should
marry his mistress, when he would procure a commission in the
army for him.</p>
<p>Roderick and the wagoner both had a profound contempt for
Weazel, and resolved to put his courage to the test by alarming
the passengers with the cry of &ldquo;a highwayman&rdquo; as soon
as a horseman should appear.&nbsp; It was dusk when a man on
horseback approached them.&nbsp; Joey gave the alarm, and a
general consternation arose; Strap leaping out of the wagon and
hiding himself behind a hedge; the usurer exclaiming dolefully
and rustling about in the straw, as though hiding something; Mrs.
Weazel wringing her hands and crying; and the captain pretending
to snore.</p>
<p>This latter artifice did not succeed with Miss Jenny, who
shook him by the shoulder and bawled out: &ldquo;&rsquo;Sdeath!
captain, is this a time to snore when we are going to be
robbed?&nbsp; Get up, for shame, and behave like a soldier and
man of honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Weazel pretended to be in a great passion for being disturbed,
and swore he would have his nap out if all the highwaymen in
England surrounded him.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are you afraid
of?&rdquo; continued he; at the same time trembling with such
agitation that the whole vehicle shook.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Plague on your pitiful soul!&rdquo; exclaimed Miss
Jenny; &ldquo;you are as arrant a poltroon as was ever drummed
out of a regiment.&nbsp; Stop the wagon, Joey, and if I have
rhetoric enough, the thief shall not only take your purse, but
your skin also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time the horseman had come up with them, and proved to
be a gentleman&rsquo;s servant, well known to Joey, who told him
the plot, and desired him to carry it on a little further, by
going up to the wagon and questioning those within.&nbsp;
Accordingly he approached, and in a terrible voice demanded,
&ldquo;Who have we got here?&rdquo;&nbsp; Isaac replied, in a
lamentable voice, &ldquo;Here&rsquo;s a poor, miserable sinner,
who has got a small family to maintain, and nothing in the world
but these fifteen <a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>shillings, which, if you rob me of, we must all starve
together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who&rsquo;s that sobbing in the corner?&rdquo;
continued the supposed highwayman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A poor, unfortunate woman,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Weazel,
&ldquo;on whom, I beg you, for Christ&rsquo;s sake, to have
compassion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you maid or wife?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wife, to my sorrow,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who, or what is your husband?&rdquo; continued he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My husband,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Weazel, &ldquo;is an
officer in the army, and was left sick at the last inn where we
dined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must be mistaken, madam,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;for
I myself saw him get into the wagon this afternoon.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Here he laid hold of one of Weazel&rsquo;s legs, and pulled him
out from under his wife&rsquo;s petticoats, where he had
concealed himself.&nbsp; The trembling captain, detected in this
inglorious situation, rubbed his eyes, and affecting to wake out
of sleep, cried, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&nbsp; The matter is not
much,&rdquo; answered the horseman; &ldquo;I only called in to
inquire after your health, and so adieu, most noble
captain.&rdquo;&nbsp; So saying, he clapped spurs to his horse,
and was out of sight in a moment.</p>
<p>It was some time before Weazel could recollect himself; but at
length, reassuming his big look, he said, &ldquo;&rsquo;Sdeath!
why did he ride away before I had time to ask him how his lord
and his lady do?&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t you remember Tom, my
dear?&rdquo; addressing his wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied she; &ldquo;I think I do remember
something of the fellow; but you know I seldom converse with
people of his station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey-day!&rdquo; cried Joey; &ldquo;do you know the
young man, coptain?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know him?&rdquo; cried Weazel; &ldquo;many a time has
he filled a glass of Burgundy for me at my Lord Trippett&rsquo;s
table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what may his neame be, coptain?&rdquo; said
Joey.</p>
<p><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>&ldquo;His name!&mdash;his name,&rdquo; replied Weazel,
&ldquo;is Tom Rinser.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wounds!&rdquo; cried Joey, &ldquo;a has changed his own
neame then! for I&rsquo;se lay any wager he was christened John
Trotter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This raised a laugh against the captain, who seemed very much
disconcerted; when Isaac broke silence and said, &ldquo;It was no
matter who or what he was, as he had not proved the robber they
suspected.&nbsp; They ought to bless God for their narrow
escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bless God!&rdquo; said Weazel, &ldquo;for what?&nbsp;
Had he been a highwayman I should have eaten his blood and body
before he had robbed me or any one in this diligence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha, ha, ha!&rdquo; cried Miss Jenny; &ldquo;I believe
you will eat all you kill, indeed, captain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The usurer was so well pleased at the end of this adventure
that he could not refrain from being severe, and took notice that
Captain Weazel seemed to be a good Christian, for he had armed
himself with patience and resignation, instead of carnal weapons,
and worked out his salvation with fear and trembling; whereupon,
amidst much laughter, Weazel threatened to cut the Jew&rsquo;s
throat.&nbsp; The usurer, taking hold of this menace,
said:&mdash;&ldquo;Gentlemen and ladies, I take you all to
witness, that my life is in danger from this bloody-minded
officer: have him bound over to the peace.&rdquo;&nbsp; This
second sneer procured another laugh against the captain, who
remained crestfallen for the rest of the journey.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> remaining miles to Gateshead
are made up of the shabby village of Low Fell, where the road
begins to rise, and the uninteresting way over the ridge of the
Fell itself.&nbsp; By the word &ldquo;Fell,&rdquo; North of
England people describe what Southerners call a hill.&nbsp; The
common land of Gateshead Fell, 675 acres, was enclosed under Acts
of Parliament, 1809, 1822.</p>

</a></p>
<p><a name="page154"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 154</span>Many
were the gibbets erected in the old days on Gateshead Fell.&nbsp;
The last was that on which swung the body of Robert Hazlett, who
on this spot, on the evening of August 6th, 1770, robbed a young
lady, Miss Margaret Benson, who was returning to Newcastle in a
post-chaise from Durham.&nbsp; On the same night a post-boy was
relieved of his bags at the same place.&nbsp; Hazlett was hanged
at Durham, and his body gibbeted here, twenty-five feet
high.&nbsp; For some time afterwards, every day for an hour, an
old man was seen to kneel and pray at the foot of the
gibbet.&nbsp; It was the wretched man&rsquo;s father!&nbsp; A
beacon was fixed on the Fell in the winter of 1803&ndash;4, on an
alarm of invasion; hence this height was afterwards known as
&ldquo;Beacon Hill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The present-day aspect of the road does not hint at anything
so tragical, and is merely commonplace, the last touch of
vulgarity added by the trams that ply along it from
Gateshead.</p>
<p>The place-name of Gateshead seemed to John Ogilby, in his
book, <i>Britannia Depicta</i>, 1676, to require explanation, and
he proceeded to say that it was &ldquo;alias Gate-Side, seated on
the Banks of the Tine, by the Saxons call&rsquo;d Gates-heved,
i.e. <i>Caprae Caput</i>, or Goat&rsquo;s-head, perchance from an
Inn with such a sign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But perchance not.&nbsp; While the Saxon name certainly was
Gatesheved, it meant &ldquo;road&rsquo;s head,&rdquo; either in
allusion to the Roman bridge across the river being broken down
and passage being possible only by water, or else referring to
the abruptly-descending land on either side, where the road would
seem to be coming to a sudden end.</p>
<p>Gateshead is to Newcastle what Southwark is to London, and the
Tyne which runs between may be likened in the same way to the
Thames.&nbsp; Comparison from any other point of view is
impossible.&nbsp; Gateshead is nowadays a great deal worse than
it was when Doctor Johnson called it &ldquo;a dirty lane leading
to Newcastle.&rdquo;&nbsp; It may be ranked among the half-dozen
dirtiest places on earth, and the lane which the Doctor saw has
sent forth miles of streets as bad as itself, so <a
name="page155"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 155</span>that the
geographical distribution of filth and squalor has in modern
times become very wide.&nbsp; There are two ways of entering
Newcastle since the High Level Bridge across the Tyne has
supplemented what used to be the old Tyne Bridge, once, and until
fifty years ago, the only way of crossing the river except by
boat.&nbsp; When Stephenson flung his High Level Bridge across
that stream, as yellow, if not as historic, as the Tiber, he
provided a roadway for general traffic beneath the railway, and
the old bridge lost its favour, simply for the reason that to
cross it the steeply descending West Street and Bottle Lane had
to be taken and the just as steeply ascending bank of the river
on the Newcastle side to be climbed; while by the High Level a
flat road was provided.&nbsp; It is true that all traffic,
pedestrian and wheeled, pays a small toll for the privilege, but
it is the lesser of the two evils.</p>
<p>Let those who have no concern with old times take their
easeful way through the gloomy portals of the High Level Bridge,
eighty-five feet above high-water mark.&nbsp; But let us examine
the steep and smelly street, paved with vile granite setts and
strewn with refuse, which conducts to the Tyne Bridge, or the
Swing Bridge as it is nowadays, since the old structure was
removed, the channel of the river deepened, and the wonderful
swinging portion of the remodelled bridge, 281 feet in length,
and swung open or closed by hydraulic power, constructed in
1876.&nbsp; With that work went the last fragments of the Roman
bridge built by Hadrian (<i>Publius Aelius Hadrianus</i>) more
than a thousand years before; a bridge which, indeed, gave the
Roman camp its name of <i>Pons &AElig;lii</i>.&nbsp; His bridge,
long in ruins, was replaced in 1248 by a medi&aelig;val structure
which was destroyed by a flood in 1771.</p>
<p>This way came the coaches, climbing into Newcastle up Sandhill
and the Side, whose steep and curving roadway remains to prove
how difficult were the ways of travellers as well as
transgressors in the old times.&nbsp; Old and new jostle
here.&nbsp; The Swing Bridge turns silently on its pivot to the
touch of a lever in its signal <a name="page156"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 156</span>tower, and a force our grandfathers
never knew performs the evolution; but side by side with this
miracle still stand the darkling lanes and steep waterside alleys
of Gateshead and Newcastle that were standing before science and
commerce, mother and daughter, came down upon the Tyne and
transformed it.</p>
<p>A writer in an old-time Northern magazine appears to have been
jolted into a bad humour respecting Newcastle&rsquo;s precipitous
old approach:&mdash;&ldquo;We have no connection whatever with
the coal-trade, and were never at Newcastle but once, passing
through it on the top of an exceedingly heavy coach, along with
about a score of other travellers.&nbsp; But, should we live a
thousand years, it would not be possible for us to forget that
transit.&nbsp; We wonder what blockhead first built Newcastle;
for before you can get into and out of it, you must descend one
hill and ascend another, about as steep as the sides of a
coal-pit.&nbsp; Had the coach been upset that day, instead of the
night before and the day after, there would have been no end and,
indeed, no beginning, to this magazine.&nbsp; We all clustered as
thickly together on the roof of the vehicle (it was a sort of
macvey, or fly) as the good people of Rome did to see Great
Pompey passing along:&mdash;but we, on the contrary, saw nothing
but a lot of gaping inhabitants, who were momentarily expecting
to see us brought low.&nbsp; We remarked one man fastening his
eye upon our legs that were dangling from the roof under an iron
rail, who, we are confident, was a Surgeon.&nbsp; However, we
kept swinging along, from side to side, as if the macvey had been
as drunk as an owl, and none of the passengers, we have reason to
believe, were killed that day&mdash;it was a maiden
circuit.&nbsp; But, after all, we love Newcastle, and wish its
coals may burn clear and bright till consumed in the last general
conflagration.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>High over head goes the High Level, and the smoke and rumble
of its trains mingle with the clash of Newcastle&rsquo;s thousand
anvils and the reek of her million chimneys; but there still
stands against the sky-line&mdash;most fittingly seen from the
Gateshead <a name="page159"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
159</span>bank at eventide, when petty details are lost and only
broad effects remain&mdash;the coroneted steeple of St. Nicholas
and the great black form of the Norman keep, reminding the
contemplative that Monkchester was the name of the city before
the Conqueror came and built that fortress whose fame as the
&ldquo;New Castle&rdquo; has remained to this day to give a title
to the place, just as the &ldquo;new work&rdquo; at Newark has
ever since stood sponsor for that town.&nbsp; Again, no sooner
have you crossed the Swing Bridge and come to Quayside than other
vestiges of old Newcastle are encountered, in the remains of the
Castle wall and the steps that lead upwards to Castle Garth,
where shoemakers and cobblers of footgear of the most waterside
and unfashionable character still blink and cobble in their
half-underground dens, the descendants, probably, of those whom a
French traveller remarked here in the time of Charles the
Second.&nbsp; If, instead of climbing these stairs, the traveller
elects to follow the track of the coaches, he will traverse
Sandhill, which in very early days was an open space by the
river, but has for centuries past been a street.&nbsp; It was at
Sandgate close by, according to the ballad, that the lassie was
heard to sing the well-known refrain of &ldquo;Weel may the keel
row, the boat that my love&rsquo;s in,&rdquo; and indeed it is a
district that breathes romance, commonplace though its modern
offices may look.&nbsp; Does not the Moot Hall look down upon
Sandhill?&nbsp; &ldquo;Many a heart has broken inside those
walls,&rdquo; said a passer-by, with unwonted picturesqueness, to
the present writer, gazing at that hall of justice.</p>
<p>There is a pretty flavour of romance&mdash;compact, it is
true, of the most unpromising materials, like the voluptuous
scents which modern science extracts from coal-tar&mdash;still
clinging to Sandhill.&nbsp; Just where a group of curious old
houses, very old, very tall, and nearly all windows, remains, the
explorer will perceive a memorial tablet let into one of the
frontages, setting forth that &ldquo;From one of the windows of
this house, now marked with a blue pane of glass, Bessie Surtees
<a name="page160"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 160</span>eloped
with John Scott, afterwards Lord Chancellor Eldon, November 18th,
1772.&rdquo;&nbsp; John Scott was twenty-one years of age at the
time, and was at home on vacation from Oxford.&nbsp; His father,
a successful coal-fitter, had sent him, as he had already done
his elder brother, William, afterwards Lord Stowell, to the
University.&nbsp; He had already gained a fellowship there, which
he forfeited on his elopement with, and marriage to, his
Bessie.&nbsp; She descended from her casement by the aid of a
ladder hidden by an accomplice in the shop below, and they were
over the Border and wedded by the blacksmith at Blackshields
before any one could pursue.&nbsp; Bessie&rsquo;s relatives were
bitterly opposed to the match, and so, nearly without resources,
the pair had to resort to London and live frugally in Cursitor
Street while he studied hard at law, instead of, as originally
intended, for the Church.&nbsp; His first year&rsquo;s earnings
scarce amounted to enough to live on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many a
time,&rdquo; said he in after years, &ldquo;have I run down from
Cursitor Street to Fleet Market, to buy sixpennyworth of sprats
for our supper.&rdquo;&nbsp; The turning-point in his career
occurred in a case in which he insisted on a legal point against
the wishes of his clients.&nbsp; The case was decided against
him, but was reversed on appeal on the point he had
contested.&nbsp; From that time continued success awaited him,
and he eventually became Lord Chancellor.&nbsp; The clashing
Romeo of an earlier day became, however, a very different person
in after years.&nbsp; Much poring over parchments and
long-continued professional strife took all the generous
enthusiasm out of him, and by ways not the most scrupulous he
amassed one of the greatest fortunes ever scraped together by a
successful lawyer.&nbsp; Bessie, meanwhile, had become quite as
much of a handful as she had been an armful.</p>
<p>Romance wanes.&nbsp; As Conservators of the Tyne, the
Corporation of Newcastle have, for the last four centuries,
proclaimed their authority by once in every five years going in
procession on the river, in various craft.&nbsp; It was on these
occasions the acknowledged <a name="page161"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 161</span>custom that, on returning and
landing, the Mayor should choose the prettiest girl in the crowds
of spectators and publicly salute her with a civic kiss.&nbsp; In
acknowledgment of this favour his Worship presented her with a
new sovereign.&nbsp; But the procession of &ldquo;Barge
Day,&rdquo; as it was called, was discontinued after May 16th,
1901, and is not likely to be revived.</p>
<p>From Sandhill the coaches journeyed along the Side, which
remains as steep and almost as picturesque as ever, even if not
rendered additionally curious by the gigantic railway arch that
spans it and clears the roofs of its tallest houses.&nbsp; The
last mail-coach left Newcastle for Berwick and Edinburgh, with
the Union Jack flying at half-mast, on July 5, 1847, and those
days are so thoroughly done with that none of Newcastle&rsquo;s
coaching inns are left.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole character of the
place has changed since little over a century and a half ago,
when John Wesley entered the opinion in his diary that it was a
&ldquo;lovely place and lovely company,&rdquo; and, furthermore,
said that &ldquo;if he were not journeying in hope of a better
world, here he would be content to live and die.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Coal had even then been shipped for centuries from Newcastle, but
miles of manufactories had not yet arisen upon the banks of
&ldquo;coaly Tyne,&rdquo; and so unprogressive was the town that
it was still, with gardens and orchards, easily comprised within
its medi&aelig;val walls; those walls which had many a time
withstood the Scots, and even when Wesley was here in 1745 were
being prepared to resist the Pretender.</p>
<p>Newcastle&mdash;difficult as it may now be to realise the
fact&mdash;was then a very small town, and was governed
accordingly.&nbsp; Primitive punishments as well as primitive
government survived until a hundred and fifty years ago, when
scolds still wore bridles or were ducked, and when local tipplers
yet perambulated the streets in the drunkard&rsquo;s cloak, an
ingenious instrument of little ease which now reposes in the
Museum.</p>
<p>Far beyond the ancient walls now extend the streets of the
modern city; Grey Street chief among them, <a
name="page162"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 162</span>classically
gloomy and extra-classically grimed to the blackness of Erebus; a
heavy Ionic pillar at its northern end bearing aloft the statue
of Earl Grey, the Prime Minister who secured the passing of the
first Reform Bill in 1832.</p>
<p>Away from the chief business streets, many of the curious old
thoroughfares may be sought, but they are nowadays the
receptacles of inconceivable dirt, and anything but
desirable.&nbsp; The narrow streets called &ldquo;chares&rdquo;
answer to the &ldquo;wynds&rdquo; of Edinburgh and the
&ldquo;rows&rdquo; of Yarmouth.&nbsp; Their name has been the
subject of jokes innumerable, and misunderstandings not a few;
as, when a judge, previously unacquainted with Newcastle, holding
an assize here, heard a witness say that he saw &ldquo;three men
come out of the foot of a chare,&rdquo; and ordered him out of
the witness-box, thinking him insane, until the jury of Newcastle
men explained matters.</p>

</a>Despite its smoke and untidiness, the folks of this grimy
Tyneside city have a good conceit of it.&nbsp; To them it is
&ldquo;canny Newcastle,&rdquo; an epithet whose meaning differs
from the Scotch, and here means &ldquo;fine,&rdquo; or
&ldquo;neat.&rdquo;&nbsp; The stranger who fails to find those
qualities, who perceives instead the defects of dirt and a pall
of smoke that blackens everything to an inky hue, and accordingly
thanks Providence that his home is elsewhere, is to the
Tynesiders a Goth.</p>
<p>For Newcastle is practical.&nbsp; It has its great newspapers,
and has produced literary men of note; but the forging of iron
and steel, the shrinking of steel jackets upon big guns, the
making of ships and all kinds of munitions of war appeal
principally to the Novocastrian who may by chance have no
especial love of that coaling trade which is pre-eminently and <a
name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>historically his.&nbsp; It is therefore quite
characteristic of Newcastle folks that, in the mid-century, a
literary man, since become famous, was as a boy solemnly warned
by a townsman against such a career as he was
contemplating.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;to hear that ye want to go to London, and to take to this
writing in the papers.&nbsp; It&rsquo;ll bring ye to no good, my
boy.&nbsp; I mind there was a very decent friend of mine, auld
Mr. Forster, the butcher in the Side.&nbsp; He had a laddie just
like you; and nothing would sarve him but he must go away to
London to get eddicated, as he called it; and when he had got
eddicated, he wouldn&rsquo;t come back to his father&rsquo;s
shop, though it was a first-class business.&nbsp; He would do
nothing but write, and write, and write; and at last he went back
again to London, and left his poor old father all alone; and
ah&rsquo;ve never heard tell of that laddie since!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of course he had not.&nbsp; What rumours of literary life in
London could then have penetrated to the shores of the
&ldquo;coaly Tyne.&rdquo;&nbsp; That laddie, however, was John
Forster, the biographer of Dickens.</p>
<p>These practical men of Newcastle have achieved the most
wonderful things.&nbsp; The home of the Stephensons was at Wylam,
only nine miles away, and so the town can fairly claim the
inventor of railways among its natives.&nbsp; We need not linger
to discuss the wonders of the locomotive; they are sufficiently
evident.&nbsp; Newcastle men have even changed the character of
their river.&nbsp; There are still those who can recollect the
Tyne as a shallow stream in which the laden &ldquo;keels,&rdquo;
heaped up with coal, not infrequently grounded.&nbsp; Nowadays
the largest war-vessels are built up-stream, at Elswick, and take
their stately way to the sea with their heavy armaments, and no
mishap occurs.&nbsp; Clanging arsenals and factories line the
banks for many more miles than the historian, anxious for his
reputation, dare mention.&nbsp; The Armstrong works alone are
over a mile long, and employ some sixteen thousand hands.&nbsp;
Lord Armstrong himself was the inventor of hydraulic machinery;
and the Swan <a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>incandescent electric lamp, which bears the name of its
inventor, was the work of a Newcastle man.&nbsp; Others of whom
England is proud were born here, notably Admiral Lord
Collingwood.&nbsp; To their practicality these men of Newcastle
add sentiment, for they have carefully placed tablets on the
houses where their celebrated men were born, and they have not
only erected a monument to Stephenson, but have also placed one
of his first engines&mdash;&ldquo;Puffing Billy&rdquo;&mdash;on a
pedestal beside the High Level Bridge, where the huge modern
expresses roar past the quaint relic, day and night, in startling
contrast.&nbsp; Also, they one and all have the most
astonishingly keen affection for their old parish church of St.
Nicholas, in these latter days become a cathedral.</p>
<p>If you would touch a Novocastrian on his most sensitive spot,
praise or criticise the cathedral church of St. Nicholas, and he
will plume himself or lose his temper, as the case may be.&nbsp;
That building, and especially its tower, with the wonderful stone
crown supported on ribbed arches and set about with its cluster
of thirteen pinnacles, is the apple of Newcastle&rsquo;s
eye.&nbsp; It figures as a stock decorative heading in the
Newcastle papers, and does duty in a hundred other ways.&nbsp;
Built toward the close of the sixteenth century, that fairy-like
corona has had its escapes, as when, during the stubborn defence
in 1644, under the Royalist Sir John Marley, the Scottish
general, Alexander Leslie, Lord Leven, commanding the besieging
forces, threatened to batter it down with his cannon if the town
were not at once surrendered.&nbsp; To this Sir John Marley made
the very practical reply of causing all his Scottish prisoners to
be placed in the tower, and sent word to the besiegers that they
might, if they would, destroy it, but that their friends should
perish at the same time.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Thief and Reiver&rdquo;
bell, a relic of old times when the outlaws of Northumberland
were given short shrift wherever and whenever found, is still
rung before the opening of the annual fair, and recalls the old
custom of giving those <a name="page166"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 166</span>gentry immunity from arrest during
fair-time; but it would probably not be safe for any one
&ldquo;wanted&rdquo; by the police to rely upon this sentimental
survival.</p>

<h2>XXVI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> fully a mile and a half on
leaving Newcastle the road runs over the Town Moor, a once wild
waste of common, and even now a bleak and forbidding open space
whose horizon on every side commands the gaunt Northumbrian
hills, or is hidden with the reek of Newcastle town, or the
collieries that render the way sordid and ugly.&nbsp;
Newcastle&rsquo;s lovely pleasance, Jesmond Dene, is hidden away
to the right from the traveller along the road, who progresses
through Bulman&rsquo;s Village (now dignified with the new name
of Gosforth), Salter&rsquo;s Lane, Wide Open and Seaton Burn with
sinking heart, appalled at the increasing wretchedness and
desolation brought by the coal-mining industry upon the
scene.&nbsp; Off to the right lies Killingworth, among the
collieries, where George Stephenson began his career in humble
fashion.&nbsp; His cottage stands there to this day.&nbsp; At the
gates of Blagdon Park, eight miles from Newcastle, where the
white bulls of the Ridleys guard the entrance in somewhat
spectral fashion, the surroundings improve.&nbsp; Here the
Ridleys have been seated for centuries, and from their wooded
domain watched the belching smoke of the pits they own, which
year by year and generation by generation have added to their
wealth.&nbsp; Lord Ridley is now the representative of these
owners of mineral wealth, and lord of Blagdon.&nbsp; Midway of
the long park wall that borders the road on the way to Morpeth
stand the modern lodge and gates, erected in 1887; with that
relic of old Newcastle, the Kale Cross, just within the grounds
and easily seen from the highway.&nbsp; The building is not so
much a cross as a market-house, and is just a classical pavilion
in the <a name="page167"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
167</span>Doric style, open on all sides to the weather.&nbsp; It
stood, until the middle of the eighteenth century, upon the Side
at Newcastle, and marked the centre of the market then held
there.&nbsp; The townsfolk presented it to the Matthew White
Ridley of the period, and here in lovelier surroundings than it
knew originally, it stands, the wreathed urns and couchant lion
on its roof contrasting finely with a dense background of
foliage.</p>
<p>Beyond the park, the road crosses the Black Dene, whence
Blagdon derives its name; one of those ravines that now begin to
be a feature of the way.&nbsp; This expands on the right hand
into Hartford Dene, to which Newcastle picnic-parties come in
summer-time for brief respite from the smoke and clangour of
their unlovely town.&nbsp; Thence, through Stannington, Clifton,
and Catchburn, and to the long and tortuous descent into Morpeth,
lying secluded in the gorge of the Wansbeck.</p>
<p>Morpeth is little changed since coaching times, but the one
very noticeable alteration shows by what utter barbarians the
town was inhabited towards the close of that era.&nbsp; Entering
it, the turbulent Wansbeck is crossed by a stone bridge, built in
1830, to provide <a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
168</span>better accommodation for the increased traffic than the
ancient one, a few yards up stream, afforded.&nbsp; For some five
years longer the old building was suffered to remain, and then,
with the exception of its piers, it was demolished.&nbsp; No one
benefited by its destruction, it stood in no one&rsquo;s way, and
its utility was such that a footbridge, a graceless thing of iron
and scantling, has been erected across those ancient piers, to
continue the access still required at this point from one bank to
the other.&nbsp; It was to our old friends the monks that
travellers were beholden for that ancient Gothic bridge, and
their old toll-house still remains, after having passed through a
varied career as a chapel, a school, and a fire-engine
house.&nbsp; Turner&rsquo;s view shows the road over the bridge,
looking south; with the castle gate-house on the hill-top, a
great deal nearer than it actually is.&nbsp; This, the sole relic
of that old stronghold, has in later years been restored until it
looks almost as new as the would-be Gothic of the gaol, which
stands beside the modern bridge on entering the town and deludes
the more ignorant into a belief of its genuine antiquity.&nbsp;
At Morpeth, until the assizes were removed to Newcastle, justice
was dispensed in this sham medi&aelig;val castle, built in 1821,
and now, all too vast for present needs, used as a
police-station.&nbsp; The old town gaol, at the other end of the
town, facing the market-place, is much more interesting.&nbsp;
Built in the likeness of a church tower, curfew is still rung
from its belfry, beneath the queer little figures on the
roof.&nbsp; Market-day brings crowds of drovers and endless
droves of sheep and cattle to this spot, to say nothing of the
pigs, singularly plentiful in these parts.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s driving his swine to Morpeth market,&rdquo; is
an expression still used of a snoring man in the
neighbourhood.&nbsp; Always excepting market-day, Morpeth is now
a curiously quiet and dreamy town.&nbsp; The stress of ancient
times has left its few relics in the mouldering remains of strong
and defensible walls, and in certain proverbs and sayings
reflecting discreditably upon the Scottish people, but the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries <a name="page171"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 171</span>are more evident in its streets than
previous eras.&nbsp; To those centuries belong the many old inns
with signs for the most part redolent of the coaching age: the
&ldquo;Nag&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Grey Nag&rsquo;s
Head,&rdquo; the &ldquo;Queen&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo;
&ldquo;Turk&rsquo;s Head,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Black Bull&rdquo;;
this last with an odd semi-circular front and a beautiful
coach-entrance displaying some fine Adam decoration.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a name="image169" href="images/p169.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>That Morpeth folk still cherish old anti-Scottish sayings is
not at all remarkable; for old manners, old sayings, and ancient
hatreds die slowly in such places as this, and moreover, the
Morpeth of old suffered terribly from Scottish raiders.&nbsp;
Later times saw a more peaceful irruption, when Scottish youths
came afoot down the great road in quest of fame and fortune in
the south.&nbsp; People looked askance upon them as Scots, while
innkeepers hated them for their poverty and their
canniness.&nbsp; Those licensed victuallers thought, with Dr.
Johnson, who did not greatly like them either, that &ldquo;the
finest prospect for a Scotchman was the high road that led him
into England.&rdquo;&nbsp; This bitter satire, by the way, was in
reply to a Mr. Ogilvie, who had been contending on behalf of the
&ldquo;great many noble wild prospects&rdquo; which Scotland
contained.&nbsp; Smollett, in his <i>Humphry Clinker</i>, shows
how greatly the Scots were misliked along this route about
1766.&nbsp; He says that, from Doncaster northwards, all the
windows of all the inns were scrawled with doggerel rhymes in
abuse of the Scottish nation.&nbsp; This fact was pointed out to
that fine Scottish character, Lismahago, and with it a
particularly scurrilous epigram.&nbsp; He read it with some
difficulty, the glass being dirty, and with the most starched
composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vara terse and vara poignant,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;but with the help of a wat dishclout it might be rendered
more clear and parspicuous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The country between Morpeth and Alnwick is dotted with
peel-towers and their ruins, built in the wild old times when the
ancestors of these peaceful Scots came in quest of spoil, laying
waste the Borders far and wide.&nbsp; One had but to turn aside
from the road at Warrener&rsquo;s <a name="page172"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 172</span>House, two miles beyond Morpeth, and
thence proceed eastward for a further two, for ten castles to be
seen at once from the vantage-point of Cockle Park Tower, itself
a fine relic of a fortress belonging in the fifteenth century to
the Ogles, situated now on a farm called by the hideous name of
Blubberymires.</p>
<p>The peculiar appropriateness of Morpeth&rsquo;s name, meaning
as it does &ldquo;moor-path,&rdquo; is fully realised when coming
up the road, up the well-named High Highlaws to where the road to
Cockle Park Tower branches off, and where an old toll-house
stands, with &ldquo;Warrener&rsquo;s House,&rdquo; a deserted
red-brick mansion, opposite.&nbsp; It is quite worth while to ask
any passing countryman the name of that house, for then the
&ldquo;Northumbrian burr&rdquo; will be heard in all its
richness.&nbsp; As De Foe remarked, two hundred years ago,
Northumbrians have &ldquo;a Shibboleth upon their Tongues,
namely, a difficulty in pronouncing the letter R,&rdquo; and in
their mouths, consequently, the name becomes, grotesquely enough,
&ldquo;Wawwener.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Causey Park Bridge, over a little rivulet, a ruined windmill,
and the remains of Causey Park Tower are the next features of the
way before reaching a rise where an old road goes scaling a
hillside to the right hand, surmounted by a farm picturesquely
named &ldquo;Helm-on-the-Hill.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thence downhill on to
Bockenfield Moor, and then precipitously down again through West
Thirston and across the picturesque bridge that spans the lovely
Coquet, into Felton: villages bordering either bank of the river,
where the angler finds excellent sport, and where the rash
cyclist, regardless of the danger-boards erected for his guidance
on the hill-tops, tries involuntary conclusions with the
aforesaid bridge at the bottom.&nbsp; A mile onward, up the
rising road, is the park of Swarland Hall, with
&ldquo;Nelson&rsquo;s Monument,&rdquo; a time-stained obelisk,
seen amid the trees within the park fence, and showing against
the sky-line as the traveller approaches the moorland height of
Rushy Cap.&nbsp; Alexander Davison, squire of Swarland Hall and
friend of the Admiral, erected it, &ldquo;not to commemorate the
<a name="page174"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 174</span>public
virtue and heroic achievements of Nelson, which is the duty of
England, but to the memory of private friendship.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Occupying so prominent a position by the roadside, it was
probably intended to edify the coach-passengers of old.&nbsp; So
to Newton-on-the-Moor&mdash;which might more fitly be named
Newton-on-the-Hill&mdash;with its half a dozen cottages and its
coal-pits, and thence by a featureless but not unpleasing road
into Alnwick.</p>

<p>It is something of a shock to the sentimental pilgrim,
northward-bound, that the entrance to historic Alnwick should be
by the gas-works, the railway station, the Farmers&rsquo; Folly
(of which more shall presently be said), and other unmistakable
and unromantic evidences of modernity that spread beyond the
ancient confines of the town to form the suburb of Bondgate
Without; but man cannot live by medievalism alone.&nbsp; The town
<a name="page177"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 177</span>itself
is gained at that point where the heavy blackened mass of
Bondgate itself spans the road, just beyond the elaborately
rebuilt &ldquo;Old Plough,&rdquo; still exhibiting, however, the
curious tablet from the old house:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>That which your Father old hath purchased and
left<br />
You to possess, do you dearly<br />
Hold to show his worthiness.&nbsp; 1714.</p>

<h2>XXVII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Alnwick</span> is a town with a great past
and a somnolent present.&nbsp; There are yawns at every turn,
echoes with every footfall, and grass growing unbidden in the
streets.&nbsp; But there are forces of elemental power at
Alnwick, little though the stranger suspects them.&nbsp; There
have of late years been periods of storm and stress in the
columns of the <i>Alnwick Gazette</i>, for instance, respecting
the local water-supply, which have drawn forth inappropriately
fiery letters from correspondents, together with many mixed
metaphors.&nbsp; How is this for impassioned
writing?&mdash;&ldquo;The retributive forces of well-balanced
justice have, after a dead ebb, returned with a swelling tide,
and overtaken the arrogative policy of the
freeholders.&rdquo;&nbsp; But this is nothing to the following
striking figure of &ldquo;the arm of scandalous jobbery steeped
to the lips in perfidious dishonour;&rdquo; a delightful literary
image unsurpassed in Ireland itself; or &ldquo;another hydra of
expense arising phoenix-like from the ashes of
misgovernment.&rdquo;&nbsp; Did the word &ldquo;hydrant,&rdquo;
we wonder, suggest this last period?&nbsp; Is the dulness of
Alnwick due to the decay following the corruption hinted
at?&nbsp; Perhaps, for, as this publicist next inquires,
&ldquo;How could anything symbolical of greatness, wrapped with
ropes of sand, ever and for aye, flourish like the green
bay-tree?&rdquo;&nbsp; Ah! how?&nbsp; It is a difficult question
to answer, and so we will leave the question at that.</p>
<p>Alnwick, of course, derives its name from its situation on the
romantic Aln: the &ldquo;wick,&rdquo; or village on that <a
name="page178"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
178</span>river.&nbsp; The name is kin to that of many other
&ldquo;wicks,&rdquo; &ldquo;weeks,&rdquo; and &ldquo;wykes&rdquo;
in England, and has its fellows in such places as High Wycombe;
Wykeham (now spelt Wickham) in Hampshire, whence came William of
Wykeham; the village of Week, near Winchester; and in the town
named simply Wick, in the north of Scotland.&nbsp; Alnwick in
these times is a place of a certain grim and lowering
picturesqueness.&nbsp; Its grey stone houses are at one with the
greyness of the Northumbrian skies, and a general air of barren
stoniness impresses the traveller as its chief feature.&nbsp; It
is an effect of prisons and jailers which reaches its height in
the open space that fronts the barbican of the castle.&nbsp; You
look, instinctively, for His Majesty&rsquo;s prison regulations
on the outer walls, and, approaching the gate, expect a
warder&rsquo;s figure at the wicket.</p>
<p>This is no uncongenial aspect of that old fortress.&nbsp; It
is rather in the Italian drawing-rooms, the picture-galleries,
and the Renaissance luxuries of the interior of the castle that
the jarring note is struck and all association with feudal times
forgotten.&nbsp; Many a Border moss-trooper has unwillingly
passed through this grim barbican, and so left the world for
ever; and many more of higher estate have found this old
stronghold of the Percies a place of lifelong durance, or have in
its dungeons met a secret end.&nbsp; For chivalry was not
inconsistent with midnight murder or treachery, and the Percies,
centred in their fortress like spiders in their webs, had all the
virtues and the vices of chivalric times.&nbsp; Ambitious and
powerful, they were alike a bulwark against the Scots and a
menace to successive kings of England, and none in those olden
times could have approached their castle gate with the equable
pulsation of the modern tourist.&nbsp; In those times, instead of
finding a broad level open space here, a deep ditch would have
been seen and a drawbridge must have been lowered before access
was possible.&nbsp; Then possibly the stone figures in violent
attitudes that line the battlements, and seem to be casting
missiles down upon the heads of visitors, may have been <a
name="page179"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 179</span>alarming;
to-day we only wonder if they could ever have tricked even the
most bat-eyed warrior into a belief that they were really living
men-at-arms.</p>
<p>The Percies, whose name attaches more than any other to
Alnwick, were, strictly speaking, never its owners.&nbsp; The
first of that name came over to England with the Conqueror in the
person of William de Percy, a younger son of the feudal lord of
the village of Percie in Normandy, which still exists to point
out to the curious tourist the spot whence this historic family
sprang.&nbsp; This William de Percy was nicknamed &ldquo;Als
Gernons,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Whiskers,&rdquo; whence derives the
name of Algernon, even now a favourite one with the
Smithson-Percies.&nbsp; &ldquo;Whiskers&rdquo; was present at the
battle of Hastings, and for his aid was granted manors in
Hampshire, Lincolnshire, and York, but none in
Northumberland.&nbsp; He died in 1086, when with the Crusaders,
near Jerusalem.&nbsp; The Percies never became connected in any
way with Alnwick, for the family of this William de Percy became
extinct in 1166, when Agnes, an only child of his descendant,
married Josceline de Lovaine; and it was not until 1309 that the
descendant of this Lovaine, who had assumed the Percy name, came
into wrongful possession of the vast estates.&nbsp; Alnwick and
sixty other baronies in Northumberland had until then been in
possession of the de Vescis, of whom Yvo de Vesci was the
original Norman owner.&nbsp; His descendant, William de Vesci,
who died in 1297, was the last of his line, and appears to have
been of a peculiarly trusting disposition.&nbsp; He put a great
(and an unfounded) faith in the honesty of churchmen, leaving all
his estates to Anthony Bek, Prince-Bishop of Durham, in trust for
an infant illegitimate son, until he should come of age.&nbsp;
But Bek picked a quarrel with his ward, and in 1309 sold the
lands to Henry Percy, who thus became the first Baron Percy of
Alnwick.</p>
<p>But let us not do an injustice to the Church.&nbsp;
Prince-Bishops were kittle cattle, an amorphous kind of
creature.&nbsp; Perhaps his lay half impelled Bek to this <a
name="page180"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 180</span>knavery,
and, following the Scriptural injunction not to let the right
hand know what is done by the left, his clerical moiety remained
in ignorance of the crime.&nbsp; Heaven be praised, there are no
longer any of these Jekyll and Hyde creatures, for the
Bishops-Palatine of Durham were abolished two generations or more
since.</p>
<p>There were, in the fulness of time, three Barons Percy of
Alnwick, and then the Barony was erected into the Earldom of
Northumberland.&nbsp; The axe and the sword took heavy toll of
this new line, for the Earls of Northumberland seldom died in
their beds, and father and son often followed one another in a
bloody death, until at length they became extinct with the death
of the eleventh and last Earl of Northumberland.&nbsp; Of these
eleven, only seven died a natural death.&nbsp; There were Percies
who fell in battle; others who, rightly or wrongly, met the death
of traitors; one was torn to pieces by a mob; and another was
obscurely done to death in prison.&nbsp; Nor did only the heads
of the family end violently; their sons and other relations led
lives as turbulent, and finished as suddenly.</p>
<p>The only child of the eleventh Earl of Northumberland was a
daughter, Elizabeth Percy.&nbsp; She married firstly the Earl of
Ogle; secondly, Thomas Thynne of Longleat, who was murdered in
Pall Mall in 1682 by Count Koningsmarck; and thirdly, the sixth
Duke of Somerset; thus bringing the Percy estates into the
Seymour family, and the Percy red hair as well.</p>
<p>It was of red-haired Elizabeth Percy, when Duchess of
Somerset, that Dean Swift wrote the bitter and diabolically
clever lines that are supposed to have lost him all chance of
becoming a bishop.&nbsp; He wrote of her as
&ldquo;Carrots&rdquo;:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Beware of carrots from Northumberland,<br />
Carrots sown <i>Thynne</i> a deep root may get,<br />
If so be they are in Sumer set;<br />
Their <i>cunnings mark</i> thou; for I have been told<br />
They assassin when young and poison when old.<br />
Root out those carrots, O thou whose name<br />
Is backwards and forwards always the same.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The one whose name was backwards and forwards alike <a
name="page181"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 181</span>was Queen
Anne, for Swift&rsquo;s purpose &ldquo;Anna.&rdquo;&nbsp; It will
be noticed that Swift not very obscurely hints that Elizabeth
Percy connived at murder.</p>
<p>Her eldest son, the seventh Duke of Somerset, had, curiously
enough, only one child, a daughter.&nbsp; She married &ldquo;the
handsomest man of his time,&rdquo; Sir Hugh Smithson, in 1740,
and thus the property came into the hands of the present
holders.</p>
<p>This most fortunate, as well as most handsome, fellow was Sir
Hugh Smithson, one of a family of Yorkshire squires whose
ancestor gained a baronetcy, created 1660, for his services to
the Stuarts.&nbsp; Sir Hugh, horn 1714, a son of Langdale
Smithson, and grandson of another Sir Hugh, the third baronet,
had little early prospect of much position in life.&nbsp; He was
a younger son, and, like many another such, he went into
trade.&nbsp; He was an apothecary.&nbsp; Having succeeded as
fourth baronet to position and wealth, and with what he had made
in commerce, the &ldquo;handsomest man&rdquo; made this very
handsome marriage.&nbsp; He had the aristocratic instinct, and,
discarding his old name, took that of Percy, to which, of course,
he had no sort of right.</p>
<p>For him in 1749 was revived the old title, Earl of
Northumberland, together with that of Baron Warkworth.&nbsp; In
1766 he became further, Duke of Northumberland and Earl Percy,
and died 1786.</p>
<p>The name of Percy is one to conjure with.&nbsp; The Lovaines,
who had assumed it, made it famous in the annals of chivalry,
with a thousand deeds of derring-do in the debateable
lands.&nbsp; Smithson, too, is a good name.&nbsp; It at least
tells of descent from an honest craftsman, and Sir Hugh&rsquo;s
knighted ancestor had, obviously, done nothing to be ashamed
of.&nbsp; Unfortunately for Sir Hugh and his successors, this
unwarranted assumption of an historic name took place so well
within the historic period that it is never likely to be
forgotten.&nbsp; George the Third, who also had the instinct of
aristocracy, kept the fact well in mind, and when, sorely against
his will, he was obliged <a name="page182"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 182</span>to confer the Dukedom of
Northumberland upon this ex-apothecary, consoled himself by
vowing that he should never obtain the Order of the Garter.&nbsp;
The duke personally solicited a blue ribbon from the king, and
observed that he was &ldquo;the first Percy who has been refused
the Garter.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; replied his
Majesty, &ldquo;that you are the first Smithson who has ever
asked for it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The huge and historic stronghold of Alnwick had by this time
become ruinous, and the Smithson duke was for a while uncertain
whether to reside here or at Warkworth.&nbsp; Alnwick, however,
found favour with him, and he set to work to render it a place
worthy of one of his quality.&nbsp; To this end he wrought havoc
with the feudal antiquities of the castle, pulling down the
ancient chapel and several of the towers, filling up the moats,
plastering the walls and ceilings, enlarging arrow-slits into
great windows, and playing the very devil with the place.&nbsp;
The military history of the castle, as expressed in the
picturesque irregularity of successive alterations and additions
during many centuries, was swept away by his zeal for uniformity,
and the interior rooms were remodelled in the taste of that age,
to serve for a residence, to such an extent that only the outer
walls retained even the appearance of a castle.&nbsp; When
Pennant wrote of it in 1767, he said:&mdash;&ldquo;You look in
vain for any marks of the grandeur of the feudal age; for
trophies won by a family eminent in our annals for military
prowess and deeds of chivalry; for halls hung with helms and
hauberks&rdquo; (good alliteration, that! but rash for Cockney
repetition), &ldquo;or with the spoils of the chase; for
extensive forests or for venerable oaks.&nbsp; The apartments are
large, and lately finished with a most incompatible
elegance.&nbsp; The gardens are equally inconsistent, trim in the
highest degree, and more adapted to a villa near London than to
the ancient seat of a great baron.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was to this
criticism of &ldquo;trimness&rdquo; that Bishop Percy
objected.&nbsp; Discussing Pennant with Dr. Johnson, he could not
sit quietly and hear him praise a man who had spoken so <a
name="page183"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
183</span>disrespectfully of Alnwick Castle and the Duke&rsquo;s
pleasure-grounds, and he eagerly opposed the Doctor, evidently
with some heat, for Johnson said, &ldquo;He has done what he
intended; he has made you very angry.&rdquo;&nbsp; To which the
Bishop replied, &ldquo;He has said the garden is trim, which is
representing it like a citizen&rsquo;s parterre, when the truth
is, there is a very large extent of fine turf and gravel
walks.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;According to your own account, sir,&rdquo; rejoined
Johnson, &ldquo;Pennant is right.&nbsp; It is trim.&nbsp; Here is
grass cut close and gravel rolled smooth.&nbsp; Is not that
trim?&nbsp; The extent is nothing against that; a mile may be as
trim as a square yard.&rdquo;&nbsp; The Bishop was
vanquished.</p>
<p>All the sham Gothic alterations made at a huge outlay by the
first Duke (with the exception of one room, which remains to show
how atrocious his style was) were swept away by Algernon, the
fourth Duke, about 1855, and at a still greater cost replaced
internally with an interminable series of salons in the Italian
style.&nbsp; Externally, the castle is a medi&aelig;val fortress;
internally it is an Italian palace.&nbsp; These works cost over
&pound;300,000, and serve to show the measure of ducal
folly.&nbsp; Make a man a duke and give him an income
commensurate, and he goes mad and builds and rebuilds, burying
himself in masonry like a maggot in a cheese.&nbsp; But it is
good for trade; and perhaps that is why Providence allows a duke
to be created now and then.</p>
<p>This magnificence for a long time created its own Nemesis, and
the Dukes of Northumberland, in their gigantic castle, were worse
off in one respect than a clerk in London suburbs in a
six-roomed, nine-inch walled, jerry-built &ldquo;villa&rdquo; at
&pound;30 a year.&nbsp; They could never get a hot dinner!&nbsp;
The kitchen is large enough, and the fireplace so huge that the
fire cannot be made up without shovelling on a ton of coals; but
the dining-room is so far away, and the communication was so bad
(involving going across courtyards open to the sky) that
everything was cold before it reached table.&nbsp; This has been
remedied, and my lords dukes now have <a name="page184"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 184</span>their food sent to them along rails
on trolleys&mdash;just as they feed the beasts at the Zoo.</p>
<p>The Dukes of Northumberland are well titled.&nbsp; They are
autocrats in that county, owning as they do 181,616 of its acres,
and drawing a rental of &pound;161,874.&nbsp; Some of them have
been insufferably egotistical.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Brislec&rdquo;
Tower, built on the neighbouring height of Brislaw by the first
Duke, is evidence sufficient to prove that.&nbsp; It is a
monument by himself to his own doings, and invites the pilgrim,
in a long bombastical inscription, to &ldquo;Look around,
behold,&rdquo; and marvel at the plantations with which he caused
the bare hillsides to be covered.</p>
<p>But the most prominent memorial in Alnwick is the well-named
&ldquo;Farmers&rsquo; Folly,&rdquo; erected to the second Duke in
1816.&nbsp; Entering or leaving the town, it is a most striking
object: a pillar 85 feet in height with the Percy lion on its
summit.&nbsp; What did the second Duke do to deserve this?&nbsp;
Did he serve his country in war?&nbsp; Was he a statesman?&nbsp;
Was he benevolent to the tenants who erected it?&nbsp; Not at
all.&nbsp; Here is the story.</p>
<p>When the nineteenth century dawned we were at war with France,
and wheat and all kinds of produce were at enormously enhanced
prices.&nbsp; The farmers, therefore, began to do very
well.&nbsp; Their banking-accounts swelled, and some of them were
on the way to realise small fortunes.&nbsp; The Duke saw this and
sorrowed because they found it possible to do more than exist,
and accordingly he added to their rents, doubling in almost every
instance&mdash;and in many others quadrupling&mdash;them.&nbsp;
But when the country entered on the long peace that followed
Waterloo, and prices fell enormously, the unfortunate farmers
found it impossible to pay their way under these added
burdens.&nbsp; Mark the ducal generosity!&nbsp; As they could not
pay, he reduced the rents by twenty-five per cent.!&nbsp; Like a
draper at his annual sale, he effected a &ldquo;great
reduction,&rdquo; an &ldquo;alarming sacrifice,&rdquo; by taking
off a percentage of what he had already imposed.&nbsp; How <a
name="page186"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
186</span>noble!&nbsp; Then the tenants, the grateful fellows,
subscribed to build the column, which is inscribed: &ldquo;To
Hugh, Duke of Northumberland, by a grateful and united
tenantry.&rdquo;&nbsp; Having done this, they went into
bankruptcy and the workhouse, or emigrated, or just gave up their
farms because they could not carry on any longer.&nbsp; The money
they had subscribed did not suffice to complete this testimonial
to Duke Hugh&rsquo;s benevolence, and so&mdash;a comic opera
touch&mdash;he subscribed the rest, and finished it
himself.&nbsp; What humorists these Smithsons are!</p>

<h2>XXVIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> road, leaving Alnwick, plunges
down from the castle barbican to the black hollow in which the
Aln flows, overhung with interlacing and over-arching
trees.&nbsp; The river is crossed here by that bridge shown in
Turner&rsquo;s picture, the &ldquo;Lion Bridge&rdquo; as it is
called, from the Percy lion, &ldquo;with tail stretched out as
straight as a broom-handle,&rdquo; standing on the parapet and
looking with steadfast gaze to the North.&nbsp; It is an addition
since Turner&rsquo;s picture was painted, and an effective one,
too.&nbsp; Also, since that time, the trees have encroached and
enshrouded the scene most completely; so that the only
satisfactory view is that looking backwards when one has emerged
from the black dell.&nbsp; And a most satisfactory view it is,
with the i&rsquo;s and t&rsquo;s of romance dotted and crossed so
emphatically that it looks like some theatrical scene, or the
optically realised home of the wicked hero of one of
Grimm&rsquo;s fairy tales.&nbsp; If this were not the beginning
of the twentieth century, one might well think twice before
venturing down into the inky depths of that over-shaded road; but
these are matter-of-fact times, and we know well that only the
humdrum burgesses of Alnwick, in their shops, are beyond; with,
instead of a medi&aelig;val duke in the castle, who would think
<a name="page187"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 187</span>nothing
of hanging a stray wayfarer or so from his battlements, only a
very modern peer.</p>
<p>The road onwards is a weariness and an infliction to the
cyclist, for it goes on in a heavy three miles&rsquo; continuous
rise up to the summit of Heiferlaw Bank, whence there is a wide
and windy view of uncomfortable looking moorlands to the north,
with the craggy Cheviots, perhaps covered with snow, to the
north-west.&nbsp; As a literary lady&mdash;Mrs.
Montagu&mdash;wrote in 1789, when on a northern journey,
&ldquo;These moors are not totally uninhabited, but they look
unblest.&rdquo;&nbsp; How true!</p>
<p>The proper antidote to this is the looking back to where, deep
down in the vale of Aln, lie town and castle, perhaps lapt in
infrequent sunshine, more probably seen through rain, but, in any
case, presenting a picture of sheltered content, and seeming to
be protected from the rude buffets of the weather by the hill on
which we are progressing and by the wooded flanks of Brislaw on
the other side.&nbsp; &ldquo;Seeming,&rdquo; because those who
know Alnwick well could tell a different tale of wintry blasts
and inclement seasons that belie the hint of this hillside
prospect for three whole quarters round the calendar and a good
proportion of the fourth.&nbsp; In this lies a suggestion of why
the Percies were so warlike.&nbsp; They and their northern foes
fought to keep themselves warm!&nbsp; Nowadays such courses would
lead to the police-court, and so football has become a
highly-popular game in these latitudes.&nbsp; But the southward
glimpse of Alnwick and its surroundings from the long rise of
Heiferlaw Bank is, when sunshine prevails, of a quite
incommunicable charm.&nbsp; The background of hills, covered with
Duke Hugh&rsquo;s woods and crowned with his tower, recalls in
its rich masses of verdure the landscapes of De Wint, and if in
the Duke&rsquo;s inscription on that tower he seems to rank
himself in fellowship with the Creator, certainly, now he has
been dead and gone these hundred and twenty years, his saplings,
grown into forest trees and clothing the formerly barren
hillsides, have effected a wonderful change.</p>

"Malcolm&rsquo;s Cross"

</a></p>
<p>Beside the road are the few remaining stones of St.
Leonard&rsquo;s Chapel, and, a short distance beyond, on the
right, in a grove of trees, Malcolm&rsquo;s Cross, marking the
spot where Malcolm Caenmore, king of Scotland, was slain in
1093.&nbsp; It replaces a more ancient cross, and was erected by
the first Duchess of Northumberland in 1774.&nbsp; It was on his
seventh foray into Northumberland, besieging Alnwick Castle, that
Malcolm was killed, in an ambush carefully prepared for
him.&nbsp; The legend, which tells how he was treacherously slain
by a <a name="page189"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
189</span>thrust of a spear in the eye by one of the Percies, who
was pretending to deliver up the castle keys on the spear&rsquo;s
point, is untrue, as of course is the popular derivation of the
family name from &ldquo;pierce eye.&rdquo;&nbsp; Moreover, the
Percies, as we have seen, did not own Alnwick until more than two
hundred years afterwards.</p>
<p>Heiferlaw, as befits so commanding a hill-top so close to the
Border, has its watch-tower, looking across the marches, whence
the outlying defenders of Alnwick, ever watchful against Scottish
raids, could give timely warning to the garrison.&nbsp; It stands
to-day a picturesque ruin, in cultivated fields that in those
fierce old times, when men had no leisure for peaceful arts and
industries, formed a portion of the wild moorland.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Blawweary,&rdquo; they call one of these fields, and the
title is as descriptive of this exposed situation as anything in
the whole range of nomenclature.&nbsp; Beyond this point the road
descends to a level stretch of country leading to North Charlton,
where a few farmsteads alone stand for a village, together with a
prominent hillock covered with trees and looking as though it
had, or ought to have, a story to it; a story which research
fails to unearth.&nbsp; Opposite, meadows called locally
&ldquo;Comby Fields,&rdquo; presumably from a series of ridges
seen in them, seem to point to some forgotten history.&nbsp;
Brownyside, adjoining, is an expanse of moorland, covered with
bracken, followed by Warenford, a pretty hamlet in a hollow by a
tiny stream, with Twizel Park on the left.&nbsp; At Belford, a
large wide-streeted village with a nowadays all too roomy
coaching inn, the &ldquo;Blue Bell,&rdquo; and an old cross with
gas-lamps fitted to it by some vandal or other, the road draws
near the coast; that storied Northumbrian sea-shore where
Bambrough Castle on its islanded rock, many miles of yellow
quicksands, and the Farne and Holy Islands are threaded out in
succession before the gaze.&nbsp; Bambrough, the apex of its
pyramidical form, just glimpsed above an intervening headland,
looks in the distance like another St. Michael&rsquo;s Mount, and
Holy Island, ahead, is a miniature fellow to it.&nbsp; The ruined
cathedral of <a name="page190"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
190</span>Holy Island, the ancient Lindisfarne, the spot whence
the missionary Aidan from Iona began the conversion of
Northumbria in 634, and where he was succeeded by that most
famous of all northern bishops and saints, the woman-hating St.
Cuthbert, is the mother-church of the north, and became possessed
in later times of great areas of land through which the road now
passes.&nbsp; Buckton, Goswick, Swinhoe, Fenwick, Cheswick, were
all &ldquo;possessions&rdquo; of the monastery; and the old
ecclesiastical parish of Holy Island, once including all these
places on the mainland, and constituting then an outlying wedge
of Durham in the county of Northumberland, although now a thing
of the past, still goes by the local name of Islandshire.&nbsp;
Buckton, now a few scattered cottages by the roadside, held a
place in the old rhyme which incidentally shows that the monks of
Lindisfarne adopted that comforting doctrine:</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Who lives a good life
is sure to live well.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Their farms and granges yielded them all that the appreciative
stomachs of these religious recluses could desire, save indeed
when the Scots swooped over the Tweed and took their produce
away.&nbsp; It is a rhyme of good living:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>From Goswick we&rsquo;ve geese, from Cheswick
we&rsquo;ve cheese;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; From Buckton we&rsquo;ve venison in store;<br />
From Swinhoe we&rsquo;ve bacon, but the Scots it have taken,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp; And the Prior is longing for more.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The yellow sands that occupy the levels and reach out at low
tide to Holy Island are treacherous.&nbsp; With the exquisite
colouring of sea and sky on a summer day blending with them, they
look at this distance like the shores of fairyland; but the grim
little churchyard of Holy Island has many memorials presenting
another picture&mdash;a picture of winter storm and shipwreck,
for which this wild coast has ever been memorable.&nbsp; Off
Bambrough, where the Farne Islands are scattered in the sea, the
scene is still recalled of the wreck of the <i>Forfarshire</i>
and Grace Darling&rsquo;s heroism; and the <a
name="page191"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 191</span>monument of
that famous girl stands in Bambrough churchyard to render the
summer pilgrim mindful of the danger of this coast.&nbsp;
Dangerous not only to those on the waters, but also to travellers
who formerly took the short cut from Berwick across the sands,
instead of going by the hilly road.&nbsp; The way, clearly marked
in daylight by a line of poles, has often been mistaken at night;
sudden storms, arising when travellers have reached midway, have
swept them out to sea; or fogs have entangled the footsteps even
of those who knew the uncharted flats best.&nbsp; Whatever the
cause, to be lost here was death.&nbsp; The classic instance,
still narrated, is that of the postboy carrying the mails from
Edinburgh on the 20th of November, 1725.&nbsp; Neither he nor the
mail-bags was ever heard of again after leaving Berwick, and it
was naturally concluded that he was lost on the quicksands in a
sea-fog.</p>
<p>Away on the west of the road rise the Kyloe hills, like
ramparts, and on their tallest ridge the church tower of Kyloe,
conspicuous for long distances, and greatly appreciated by
sailors as a landmark.&nbsp; The village is not perhaps famous,
but certainly notable for a former vicar, who apparently aspired
to writing a personal history of his parish as well as keeping a
merely formal set of registers.&nbsp; Scattered through his
official records are some very curious notes, among them:
&ldquo;1696.&nbsp; Buried, Dec. 7, Henry, the son of Henry Watson
of Fenwick, who lived to the age of 36 years, and was so great a
fool that he could never put on his own close, nor never went a
&frac14; mile off ye house in all this space.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The road at this point was the scene of Grizel
Cochrane&rsquo;s famous exploit, in 1685, when at night-fall,
disguised as a man, and mounted on horseback, she waylaid the
mail rider, and, holding a pistol to his head, robbed him of the
warrant he was carrying for the execution of her father, Sir John
Cochrane, taken in rebellion against James the Second.&nbsp; By
this means she obtained a fortnight&rsquo;s respite, a delay
which was used by his friends to secure his pardon.&nbsp; <a
name="page192"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 192</span>Grizel
Cochrane has, of course, been ever since the heroine of Border
song.&nbsp; A clump of trees on a hillock, surrounded by a wall,
to the right of the road, long bore the name of
&ldquo;Grizzy&rsquo;s Clump,&rdquo; but it has recently been
felled and so much of the landmark destroyed.&nbsp; The country
folk, possessed of the most invincible ignorance of the subject,
know the place only as &ldquo;Bambrough Hill,&rdquo; a title they
have given it because from the summit an excellent view of
Bambrough Castle is gained.</p>

<p>The plantations of Haggerston Castle now begin to cover the
land sloping down toward the sea, and, after passing a deserted
building on the left, once a coaching inn, the park surrounding
the odd-looking modern castellated residence is reached.&nbsp;
Here, by the entrance to the house, the road goes off at an acute
angle to the left, and, continuing thus for a quarter of a mile,
turns as sharply to the right.&nbsp; An old manorial
pigeon-house, still with a vane bearing the initials C.L.H.,
stands by the way, and bears witness to the ownership <a
name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 193</span>of the
estate in other times by the old Haggerston family.&nbsp; It was
to Sir Carnaby Haggerston that those initials belonged, the late
eighteenth-century squire, who destroyed the old Border tower of
Haggerston Castle, and built a new mansion in its stead, just as
so many of his contemporaries did.</p>
<p>Sir Carnaby Haggerston does not appear&mdash;apart from this
vandal act of his&mdash;to have been an especially Wicked Squire,
although his devastating name launched him upon the world
ear-marked for commission of all the crimes practised by the
libertine landowners who made so brave a show in a certain class
of literature and melodrama once popular.&nbsp; His name strikes
the ear even more dramatically than that of Sir Rupert
Murgatroyd, the accursed Baronet of Ruddigore in Mr. W. S.
Gilbert&rsquo;s comic opera, but he never lived up to its
possibilities.&nbsp; The only things he seems to have had in
common with the typical squire of old seem to have been a love of
port and whist, and a passion for building houses too large for
his needs or means.</p>
<p>The Wicked Squire who unwillingly sat to the novelists who
used to write in the pages of <i>Reynolds&rsquo; Miscellany</i>
and journals of that stamp fifty years ago, as the high-born
villain of their gory romances, may be regretted, because without
him the pages of the penny novelist are become extremely tame;
but his disappearance need not be mourned for any other
reasons.</p>
<p>It is to him we owe the many supposedly
&ldquo;classical&rdquo; mansions that, huge and shapeless, like
so many factories, reformatories, or workhouses, affront the
green sward, the beautiful gardens, and the noble trees of many
English parks.&nbsp; To build vast mansions of this
&ldquo;palatial&rdquo; character, the squires often pulled down
middle-Tudor or Elizabethan, or even earlier manor-houses of
exquisite beauty, vying with one another in the size and
extravagance of the new buildings, whose original cost and
subsequent maintenance have during the past hundred and fifty
years kept many county families in straitened circumstances, and
do so still.&nbsp; There was a squire who pulled down a <a
name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 194</span>whole
series of medi&aelig;val wayside crosses in his district, and
used the materials as building-stones toward the great mansion he
was erecting for the purpose of outshining a neighbour.&nbsp;
Those transcendent squires, the noblemen of old, had larger
opportunities and made the worst use of them.&nbsp; The Duke of
Buckingham, for example, bought a property, demolished the
Elizabethan hall that stood on it, and built Stowe there in its
place; a building of vast range and classic elevation with
colonnades and porticoes, and &ldquo;windows that exclude the
light and lead to nothing,&rdquo; as some one has very happily
remarked.&nbsp; Sir Francis Dashwood, that hero of the Hell Fire
Club, pulled down West Wycombe church and built the existing
building, that looks like a Lancashire cotton-mill, and every one
built houses a great deal larger than were wanted or they could
afford; which, like the Earl of Leicester&rsquo;s seat at Holkham
were so little like homes that they could neither live in their
stately apartments nor sleep in their vast bedrooms.&nbsp; Like
the Earl and Countess of Leicester, who were compelled for
comfort&rsquo;s sake to sleep in one of the servants&rsquo;
bedrooms in the attics, they lived as settlers in corners of
their cavernous and uncomfortable palaces.</p>
<p>Pity the poor descendant of the Squires!&nbsp; He cannot
afford in these days to keep up his huge house; to pull it down
would in itself cost a fortune; and its very size frightens the
clients of the house-agent in whose hands he has had it for
letting, these years past.&nbsp; All over England this is seen,
and the old Yorkshire tale would stand true of any other county
and of many other county magnates of that time.&nbsp; The Marquis
of Rockingham, according to that story, built a mansion at
Wentworth big enough for the Prince of Wales; Sir Rowland Winn
built one at Nostel Priory fit for the Marquis of Rockingham; and
Mr. Wrightson of Cusworth built a house fit for Sir Rowland
Winn.&nbsp; No doubt the farmers carried on the tale of
extravagance down to their stratum of society, and so <i>ad
infinitum</i>.</p>
<p><a name="page195"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 195</span>But
to return to Haggerston Castle, which now belongs to the
Leylands.&nbsp; Conspicuous for some distance is the tower built
of recent years to at one and the same time resemble a
medi&aelig;val keep and to serve a practical purpose as a
water-tower, engine-room, and look-out.&nbsp; The place, however,
is remarkable for quite other things than its mock castle, for in
the beautiful park are kept in pens, or roaming about freely,
herds of foreign animals which make of it a miniature Zoological
Gardens.&nbsp; It is, in a sense, superior indeed to that
well-known place, for if the collections do not cover so wide a
range, the animals are in a state of nature.&nbsp; Emus, Indian
cattle, kangaroos, and many varieties of wild buck roam this
&ldquo;paradise,&rdquo; together with a thriving herd of American
bison.&nbsp; The bison is almost extinct, even in his native
country, but here he flourishes exceedingly and perpetuates his
kind.&nbsp; A bison bull is a startling object, come upon
unawares, and looks like the production of a lunatic artist
chosen to illustrate, say, the Jabberwock in <i>Alice in
Wonderland</i>.&nbsp; He is all out of drawing, with huge shaggy
forelegs, and head and shoulders a size too large for the rest of
his body; an eye like a live coal, tufted coat, like a worn-out
door-mat, and uncomfortable-looking horns: the kind of creature
that inhabits Nightmare Country, popularly supposed to be bred of
indigestion and lobster mayonnaise.</p>
<h2>XXIX</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Beyond</span> Haggerston, and up along the
rising road that leads for six of the seven miles to Berwick, the
journey is unexpectedly commonplace.&nbsp; The road has by this
time turned away from the sea, and when it has led us through an
entirely charming tunnel-like avenue of dwarf oaks, ceases to be
interesting.&nbsp; Always upwards, it passes collieries, the
&ldquo;Cat&rdquo; inn, and the hamlet of Richardson&rsquo;s Stead
or Scremerston, <a name="page196"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
196</span>whence, arrived at the summit of Scremerston Hill, the
way down into Tweedmouth and across the Tweed into Berwick is
clear.</p>
<p>Tweedmouth sits upon the hither shore of Tweed, clad in grime
and clinkers.&nbsp; Like a mudlark dabbling in the water but not
cleansing himself in it, Tweedmouth seems to acquire no
inconsiderable portion of its dirt from its foreshore.&nbsp;
Engineering works and coal-shoots are responsible for the
rest.&nbsp; Little or nothing of antiquity enlivens its mean
street that leads down to the old bridge and so across the Tweed
into Scotland.&nbsp; The roofs of Berwick, clustered close
together and sealing one over the other as the town ascends the
opposite shore of the river, are seen, with the spired Town Hall
dominating all at the further end of the long, narrow,
hump-backed old structure, and away to the left that fine viaduct
of the North Eastern Railway, the Royal Border Bridge.&nbsp; But
the finest view, and the most educational in local topography, is
that gained by exploring the southern shore of the Tweed for half
a mile in an easterly direction.&nbsp; An unlovely waterside
road, it is true, a maze of railway arches spanning it, and
shabby houses hiding all but the merest glimpses of Tweedmouth
church and its gilded salmon vane, referring to the
salmon-fishery of the Tweed, but leading to a point of view
whence the outlook to the north-west is really grand.&nbsp;
There, across the broad estuary of the Tweed, lies Berwick,
behind its quays and its enclosing defences.&nbsp; Across the
river, in the middle distance, goes Berwick Bridge, its massive
piers and arches looking as though carved out of the rock, rather
than built up of single stones.&nbsp; Beyond it, in majestic
array, go the tall arches of the Royal Border Bridge, and, in the
background, are the Scottish hills.&nbsp; Tweedmouth, its timber
jetty, its docks, and church spire, and its waterside lumber are
in the forefront.&nbsp; This, then, is the situation of Berwick,
for centuries the best-picked bone of contention between the
rival countries of England and Scotland; the Border <a
name="page198"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 198</span>cockpit,
geographically in the northern kingdom, but wrested from it by
the masterful English seven hundred and fifty years ago, and
taken and re-taken by or from stubborn Scots on a round dozen of
occasions afterwards.&nbsp; Sieges, assaults, stormings,
massacres under every condition of atrocity; these are the merest
commonplaces of Berwick&rsquo;s story, until the mid-sixteenth
century; and the historian who would write of its more unusual
aspects must needs turn attention to the rare and short-lived
interludes of peace.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It was in 1550, during the short reign of Edward the Sixth,
that the existing fortifications enclosing the town were begun,
whose river-fronting walls are so conspicuous from
Tweedmouth.&nbsp; The old bridge, built by James the First, was
the first peaceful enterprise between the two kingdoms, for,
although Berwick had for over a century been recognised as a
neutral or &ldquo;buffer&rdquo; state, peace went armed for fear
of accidents, and easy communication across the Tweed was not
encouraged.&nbsp; There is food for reflection in comparison
between that bridge and the infinitely greater work of the
railway viaduct.&nbsp; The first, 1,164 feet in length, with only
17 feet breadth between the parapets, bridging the river with
fifteen arches, cost &pound;17,000, and took twenty-four years to
build; the railway bridge of twenty-eight giant arches, each of
61&frac12; feet span, and straddling the Tweed at a height of 129
feet, was built in three years, at a cost of
&pound;120,000.&nbsp; The &ldquo;Royal Border Bridge,&rdquo; as
it was christened at its opening by the Queen, has precisely the
appearance of a Roman aqueduct and belongs to the Stone and Brick
Age of railways.&nbsp; Were it to do over again, there can be no
doubt that, instead of a long array of graceful arches, half a
dozen lengths of steel lattice girders would span the tide.&nbsp;
It was at a huge cost that England and Scotland were thus joined
by rail; bridge and approaches swallowing up the sum of
&pound;253,000.&nbsp; The first passenger train crossed over,
October 15, 1848, but the works were not finally completed until
1850.&nbsp; In the August of that year the <a
name="page199"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 199</span>Queen
formally opened it, nearly two years after it was <i>actually</i>
opened; a fine object-lesson for satirists.&nbsp; How we laugh at
ceremonials less absurd than this when they take place in China
and Japan.</p>
<p>Berwick town is seen, on entering its streets, to be
unexpectedly modern and matter-of-fact.&nbsp; The classically
steepled building that bulks commandingly in the main
thoroughfare and looks like a church is the Town Hall, and
displays the arms of Berwick prominently, the municipal
escutcheon supported on either side by a sculptured bear sitting
on his rump and surrounded by trees.&nbsp; It is thus that one of
the disputed derivations of Berwick&rsquo;s name is alluded
to.&nbsp; At few towns has the origin of a place-name been so
contested as at Berwick; and, for all the pother about it, the
question is still, and must remain, unanswered.&nbsp; It might as
reasonably have come from <i>aberwic</i>, the mouth of a river,
as from <i>bergwic</i>, the hillside village, and much more
reasonably than from the fanciful &ldquo;bar&rdquo; prefix
alluding to the bareness of the country; while of course the
legend that gives the lie to that last variant, and seeks an
origin in imaginary bears populating mythical woods, is merely
infantile.</p>
<p>The church-like Town Hall, which is also a market-house and
the town gaol, does indeed perform one of the functions of a
church, for the ugly Puritan parish church of the town has no
tower, and so the steeple of the Town Hall rings for it.</p>
<p>In the broad High Street running northward from this
commanding building are all the prominent inns of the town, to
and from which the coaches came and went until the opening of the
Edinburgh and Berwick Railway in 1846.&nbsp; Some of the short
stages appear to have been misery-boxes, according to Dean
Ramsay, who used to tell an amusing anecdote of one of
them.&nbsp; On one occasion a fellow-traveller at Berwick
complained of the rivulets of rain-water falling down his neck
from the cracked roof.&nbsp; He drew the coachman&rsquo;s
attention to it on the first opportunity, but all the answer he
got was the <a name="page200"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
200</span>matter-of-fact remark, &ldquo;Ay, mony a ane has
complained o&rsquo; that hole.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The mail-coaches leaving Berwick on their journey north were
allowed to take an extra&mdash;a fourth&mdash;outside
passenger.&nbsp; Mail-coaches running in England were, until
1834, strictly limited to four inside and three outside.&nbsp; Of
these last, one sat on the box, beside the coachman, while the
other two were seated immediately behind, on the fore part of the
roof, with their backs to the guard.&nbsp; This was a rule
originally very strictly enforced, and had its origin in the fear
that, if more were allowed, it would be an easy matter for
desperadoes to occupy the seats as passengers and to suddenly
overpower both coachman and guard.&nbsp; The guard in his
solitary perch at the back, with his sword-case and blunderbuss
ready to hand, could have shot or slashed at those in front, on
his observing any suspicious movement, and it is somewhat
surprising that no nervous guard ever did wound some innocent
passenger who may have turned round to ask him a question.&nbsp;
The concession of an extra seat on the outside of coaches
entering Scotland was granted to the mail-contractors in view of
the more widely scattered population of Scotland, and of the
comparative scarcity of chance passengers on the way.</p>
<p>But there is very great uncertainty as to the number of
passengers allowed on the mails in later years.&nbsp; Moses
Nobbs, one of the last of the old mail-guards, states that no
fewer than eight passengers were allowed outside at the end of
the coaching age.&nbsp; Doubtless this was owing both to the
complaints of the contractors that with the smaller complement
they could not make the business pay, and to the growing security
of the roads.</p>
<p>Royal proclamations used, until recent times, to specifically
mention &ldquo;our town of Berwick-upon-Tweed&rdquo; when
promulgating decrees, for as by treaty an independent State,
neither in England nor Scotland, laws and ordinances affecting
Great Britain and Ireland could not legally be said to have been
extended <a name="page201"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
201</span>to Berwick without the especial mention of &ldquo;our
town.&rdquo;&nbsp; A state whose boundaries north and south were
Lamberton Toll and the Tweed, a distance of not more than four
miles, with a corresponding extent from east to west, it was thus
on a par with many a petty German principality.&nbsp; Nearly
three-quarters of the land comprised within &ldquo;Berwick
Bounds&rdquo; is the property of the Corporation, having been
granted by James the First when, overjoyed at his good fortune in
succeeding to the English crown and thus uniting those of the two
countries, he entered upon his heritage.&nbsp; Lucky
Berwick!&nbsp; Its freehold property brings in a revenue of
&pound;18,000 a year, in relief of rates.</p>
<p>If the streets of Berwick are disappointing in so historic a
place, then let the pilgrim make the circuit of the town on the
ramparts.&nbsp; These, at least, tell of martial times, as also
do the fragmentary towers of the old castle, the few poor relics
left of that stronghold by the modern railway station overhanging
a deep cleft.&nbsp; Then, away in advance of the ramparts, still
thrusting its tubby, telescopic, three-storied form forward, is
the old Bell Tower, where, in this advanced post, the vigilant
garrison kept eyes upon the north, whence sudden Scottish raids
might be developed at any time.</p>
<p>Grass covers the ramparts and sprouts in tufts upon the
gun-platforms contrived in early Victorian days upon them, and
almost every variety of obsolete cannon, short of the
demi-culverins with which Drake searched the Spanish Main, go to
make up what&mdash;Heaven help them and us!&mdash;War Office
officials call batteries.&nbsp; Guns bristle thickly upon the
waterside batteries overlooking the harbour, but not one of them
is modern.&nbsp; All are muzzle-loading pieces, fit for an
artillerist&rsquo;s museum, and their carriages&mdash;where they
are mounted at all&mdash;are in bewildering variety, principally,
however, of rotting wood.&nbsp; The most recent piece, an
Armstrong gun not less than fifty years old, lies derelict in the
long grass, and children amuse themselves by filling its
hungry-looking maw with clods.&nbsp; Pot-bellied like all the old
Armstrongs, <a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>it has a look as though it had grown fat and lazy with
that diet and lain down in the long grass to sleep.&nbsp; Perhaps
to guard its slumbers, a War Office notice beside the prostrate
gun vainly forbids trespassing!</p>
<p>Down in a ditch of the fortifications a soldier in his shirt
sleeves, his braces dangling about his legs, is tending early
peas with all the tenderness of a mother for an invalid child;
for, look you, early peas in these latitudes have a hard fight
for it; and the fight of those vegetables for existence against
the nipping blasts that sweep from off the North Sea is the only
sign of warfare the place has to show.&nbsp; Taken as a whole,
and looked at whichever way you will, the &ldquo;defences&rdquo;
of Berwick-upon-Tweed show a trustfulness in Providence and in
the astounding luck of the British Empire which argues much for
the piety or the folly of our rulers.&nbsp; And so, with the
varied reflections these things call forth, let us away up the
High Street, and, passing under the archway of the Scotch Gate,
spanning its northern extremity, leave Berwick on the way to
Scotland.</p>
<h2>XXX</h2>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Seeing</span> Scotland,
Madam,&rdquo; said Dr. Johnson, in answer to Mrs. Thrale&rsquo;s
expressed wish to visit that country, &ldquo;is only seeing a
worse England.&nbsp; It is seeing the flower gradually fade away
to the naked stalk.&rdquo;&nbsp; This bitter saying of the
Doctor&rsquo;s comes vividly to mind when leaving Berwick on the
way to Edinburgh.&nbsp; Passing the outskirts of the town at a
point marked on the Ordnance map with the unexplained name of
&ldquo;Conundrum,&rdquo; the country grows bare and treeless on
approaching the sea, and at Lamberton Toll, three miles north,
where &ldquo;Berwick Bounds&rdquo; are reached and Scotland
entered, the scene is desolate in the extreme.&nbsp; The cottage
to the left of the road at this point, formerly the toll-house of
the turnpike-gate that stood here, is a famous place, <a
name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 203</span>rivalling
Gretna Green for the runaway matches, legalised at the gate until
1856, when changes in the law rendered a part of the
once-familiar notice in the window out-of-date.&nbsp; It ran,
&ldquo;Ginger-beer sold here, and marriages performed on the most
reasonable terms&rdquo;; an announcement which for combination of
the trivial and the tremendous it would be difficult to beat.</p>
<p>Geographically in Scotland when across the Tweed, we are not
politically in that country until past this cottage.&nbsp; Then
indeed we are, in many ways, in a foreign country.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">

</a></p>
<p>Scots law is a fearful and wonderful variant from
English.&nbsp; Even its terminology is strange to the English
ear, which finds&mdash;hey, presto!&mdash;on passing Berwick
Bounds, a barrister changed into an &ldquo;advocate,&rdquo; a
solicitor converted into a &ldquo;Writer to the Signet,&rdquo;
and a prosecutor masquerading under the thrilling and descriptive
alias of &ldquo;pursuer.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was the laxity of Scots
law that made, not only Gretna Green, but any other place over
the Border from England, a resort of those about to marry and
impatient of constraints, legal or family, at any period between
1753 and 1856.&nbsp; Gretna Green and its neighbour, Springfield,
in especial, and in no small degree Lamberton Toll, were the
scenes of much hasty marrying during that space of time.&nbsp;
Marrying, <i>bien entendu</i>, and not giving in marriage, for <a
name="page204"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 204</span>these were
runaway matches, and those whose position it was to give, and who
withheld their consent, generally came posting up to the
toll-gate in pursuit just in time to hear the last words of the
simple but effective ritual of the toll-keeper who had witnessed
the declaration of the truants that, &ldquo;This is my
wife,&rdquo; and &ldquo;This is my husband,&rdquo; a simple form
of words which, uttered in the presence of a witness, was all
that the beneficent legal system of Scotland required as marriage
ceremony.&nbsp; This form completed, and for satisfaction&rsquo;s
sake a rough register subscribed, the indignant parent, who
possibly had been battering on the outside of the door, was
admitted and introduced to his son-in-law.</p>
<p>It was a century of licence (not marriage licence), that
prevailed on the Border from the passing of Lord
Hardwicke&rsquo;s Clandestine Marriage Act in 1753 until that of
Lord Brougham in 1856, which put a stop to this &ldquo;over the
Border&rdquo; marrying by rendering unions illegal on the part of
those not domiciled in Scotland, which had not been preceded by a
residence in that kingdom of not less than twenty-one days by one
or other of the contracting parties.</p>
<p>There was no special virtue in the first place across the
Border-line at any point, nor did it matter who
&ldquo;officiated,&rdquo; the person who &ldquo;performed the
ceremony&rdquo; being only a witness and in no sense a clergyman;
but it was obviously, with these legal facilities, the prime
object of runaway couples pressed for time, and with hurrying
parents and guardians after them, to seize their opportunity at
the first place, and at the hands of the first person in that
liberal minded land.&nbsp; Not that the Kirk looked benevolently
upon this.&nbsp; It fined them, for discipline&rsquo;s sake, and
the happy couples cheerfully paid, for by doing so they acquired
the last touch of validity, which, on the face of it, could not
be called into dispute.</p>
<p>One of this long line of Hymen&rsquo;s secular priesthood at
Lamberton Toll had, early in the nineteenth century, an unhappy
time of it, owing to an error of judgment and an ignorance of the
law scarcely credible.&nbsp; Joseph <a name="page207"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 207</span>Atkinson, the toll-keeper, was away
one day at Berwick when a runaway pair arrived at the gate.&nbsp;
His wife, or another, sent them after him, and in Berwick the
ceremony, such as it was, was performed.&nbsp; Now Berwick is a
county of itself, and the inhabitants boast, or used to, that
their town belongs to neither England nor Scotland.&nbsp; It is
hinted (by those who do not belong to Berwick) that it belongs
instead to the devil, which possibly is a reminiscence of the
townsfolk&rsquo;s smuggling days, on the part of those who duly
render unto C&aelig;sar.&nbsp; This by the way.&nbsp; Unhappily
for Mr. Joseph Atkinson, Berwick owes allegiance to English law,
as he found when his ceremony was declared null and void, and he
was duly sentenced to seven years transportation for having
contravened the Marriage Act of 1753.</p>

<p>Halidon Hill, where the English avenged Bannockburn upon the
Scots in 1333, is on the crest of the upland to the west of
Lamberton Toll.&nbsp; Now the road runs upon the edge of the
black cliffs that plunge down into the North Sea, commanding bold
views of a stern and iron-bound coast.&nbsp; Horses, coachmen,
guards, and passengers alike quailed before the storms that swept
these exposed miles, and even the highwaymen sought other and
more sheltered spots.&nbsp; Macready, on tour in the north, was
snowed up here, in the severe winter of 1813&ndash;14.&nbsp;
Coming south through the deep and still falling snow, he
travelled in a cutting made in the drifts for miles between Ross
Inn and Berwick-on-Tweed.&nbsp; &ldquo;We did not reach
Newcastle,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;until nearly two hours after
midnight: and fortunate was it for the theatre and ourselves that
we had not delayed our journey, for the next day the mails were
stopped; nor for more than six weeks was there any conveyance by
carriage between Edinburgh and Newcastle.&nbsp; After some weeks,
a passage was cut through the snow for the guards to carry the
mails on horseback, but for a length of time the communications
every way were very irregular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where the little Flemington Inn stands solitary at <a
name="page208"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 208</span>a fork of
the road, close by a tremendous gap in the cliffs, is placed
Burnmouth station, on the main line, wedged in a scanty foothold,
hundreds of feet above the sea.&nbsp; Day or night it is a
picturesque place, but more especially in the afterglow of
sunset, when the inky blackness of the rift in the cliffs can
still be set off against the gleam of the sea, caught in a notch
of the rocks, and when the lighted signal-lamps of the little
junction glow redly against the sky on their tall masts, like
demon eyes.&nbsp; A fishlike, if not an ancient, smell lingers
here, for Burnmouth station is constantly in receipt of the
catches made down below by the hardy fishers of the three hamlets
of Burnmouth, Partinghal, and Ross, queer fishing villages of
white-washed stone cottages that line the rocky shore unsuspected
by ninety-nine among every hundred travellers along the road
above.&nbsp; Herrings caught in the North Sea are cured here,
packed in barrels, and sent by rail to distant markets.</p>
<p>Ayton, two miles onward, away from the sea, is entered in
perplexing fashion, downhill and by a sharp turn to the right
over a bridge spanning the Eye Water, instead of continuing
straight ahead along a road that makes spacious pretence of being
the proper way.&nbsp; Ayton itself, beyond being a large village,
with a modern castellated residence in the Scottish baronial
style and vivid red sandstone at its entrance, is not
remarkable.</p>
<p>Leaving Ayton, the road enters a secluded valley whose
solitudes of woodland, water, and meadows are not imperilled, but
only intensified, by the railway, which goes unobtrusively within
hail of this old coaching highway.&nbsp; On the right rise the
gently swelling sides of a range of hills sloping upwards from
the very margin of the road and covered with woods of dwarf oak,
through whose branches the sunlight filters and lies on the ferns
below in twinkling patches of gold.&nbsp; Here stood the old
Houndwood Inn, and the building yet remains, converted&mdash;good
word in such a connection&mdash;into a manse for the Free Church
near by, itself a building calculated to make angels <a
name="page209"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 209</span>weep; if
angels have appreciations in architecture.&nbsp; Another, and a
humbler, building carries on the licensed victualling trade, and
calls itself, prettily enough, the &ldquo;Greenwood
Inn.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is, in fact, a stretch of country that makes
for inspiration in the rustic sort.&nbsp; If there were a sign of
the &ldquo;Robin Hood&rdquo; here we should acclaim it romantic
and appropriate, even though tradition tells not of that mythical
outlaw in these marches.&nbsp; If not Robin, then some other
chivalric outlaw surely should have pervaded the glades of
Houndwood, open as they are, with never a fence, a hedge, or a
ditch to the road, just as though these were still the fine free
days of old, before barbed-wire fences were dreamed of, or
notices to trespassers set up, threatening vague penalties to be
enforced &ldquo;with all the rigour of the law,&rdquo; as the
phrase generally runs.</p>
<p>It is a valley of whose delights one must needs chatter,
although with but dim hopes of communicating much of its
charm.&nbsp; Through it that little stream called by the
medicinally sounding name, the Eye Water, wanders with a feminine
hesitancy and inconstancy of purpose.&nbsp; It flows all ways by
turns and never long in any direction, and with so many amazing
loops and doublings, that it might well defy the precision of the
Ordnance chartographers themselves.&nbsp; We bid farewell to this
fickle stream at Grant&rsquo;s House, and scrape acquaintance
with another, the Pease Burn, flowing in another direction.&nbsp;
For Grant&rsquo;s House stands on the watershed which orders the
going of several watercourses.&nbsp; It is also the summit level
of this railway route to the North.&nbsp; Here, quite close to
the road, is Grant&rsquo;s House station, and here, bordering the
road itself, are the houses that form Grant&rsquo;s House
itself.&nbsp; This sounds like speaking in paradox, but the place
is a village, or rather a scattered collection of pretty cottages
that have gathered around the one inn which was the home of the
original Grant.&nbsp; The place-name seems to hint of other and
less-travelled times, when these Borders were sparsely settled
and wayfarers few; when but one house served <a
name="page210"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 210</span>to take the
edge off the solitude, and that an inn kept by one Grant.&nbsp;
The imagination, thus uninstructed, weaves cocoons of speculation
around these premises and conceives him to have been a host of
abounding personality, thus to hand his name down to posterity,
preserved in a place-name, like a fly in amber.&nbsp; But all
speculations that start upon this innkeeping basis would be
incorrect, for this sponsorial Grant was the contractor who made
the road from Berwick to Edinburgh, building a cottage for
himself in this then lonely spot, which only in later years
became the Grant&rsquo;s House inn.</p>
<p>More streams and woods beyond this point, and then comes the
long and toilsome rise up to Cockburnspath, past Pease Burn,
where the road takes a double S curve on the hillside, and other
tall hills, to right and left and ahead, largely covered with
firs and larches, seem to look on with a gloomy anticipation of
some one, less cautious than his fellows, breaking his
neck.&nbsp; Where there are no hillside woods there are grass
meadows in which, if it be June or July, the haymakers can be
seen from the road, haymaking, with attendant horses and carts,
at a perilous angle.&nbsp; The Pease Burn, flowing deep down in
its Dene, is spanned at a height of 127 feet, half a mile down
stream, by a four-arched bridge, built in 1786.</p>
<h2>XXXI</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Set</span> in midst of these steep and
twisting roads and above these watery ravines is Cockburnspath
Tower, a ruined Border castle of rust-red stone that frowns down
upon the road on the edge of a tremendous gully.&nbsp; It was
never more than a peel-tower, but strongly placed and solidly
built, a fitting refuge for those who took part in the ups and
downs of Border forays.&nbsp; In the days when Co&rsquo;path
Tower (local pronunciation) was built, every one&rsquo;s house
was more or <a name="page211"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
211</span>less a defensible building.&nbsp; &ldquo;An
Englishman&rsquo;s house is his castle&rdquo; is a figurative
expression commonly used to prefigure the inviolate character of
the law-abiding citizen&rsquo;s domicile, but it might have been
said literally of dwellers in these debateable lands.&nbsp; The
more property he possessed, the stronger was the Border
farmer&rsquo;s tower.&nbsp; When the moss-troopers and
medi&aelig;val scoundrels of every description were on the
warpath, or merely out on a cattle-lifting expedition, these
embattled agriculturists shut themselves up in their safe
retreats.&nbsp; The lower floor, on a level with the ground,
received the live stock; the floor above, the servants; and to
the topmost story, as the safest situation, the family
retired.&nbsp; The gate below was of iron, for your Border reiver
was no squeamish sort, and would burn these domestic garrisons
alive without hesitation.&nbsp; Therefore in the most approved
type of fortress there was nothing inflammable.&nbsp; Sympathy,
however, would be wasted on those old-time cultivators, for they
all took a turn at armed cattle-lifting as occasion offered, and
found the readiest way of stocking their farms with every
requisite to be that of stealing what they required.</p>
<blockquote><p>For why?&nbsp; Because the good old rule<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sufficeth them: the simple plan<br />
That they should take who have the power,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And they should keep who can.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Short and sudden forays were characteristic of this kind of
life.&nbsp; The Border cattle-lifter came and went in the
twinkling of an eye, and drove the captured flocks and herds away
with him at a rate no merely honest drover ever marshalled his
sheep and heifers to market.&nbsp; There must have been many
highly desirable, but inanimate and not easily portable, things
which the raiders were obliged to leave behind, as one of this
kidney regretted in casting a last glance at a hayrick he had no
means of lifting.&nbsp; &ldquo;Had ye but four feet, ye suld no
stand lang there,&rdquo; said he, as he turned to go.</p>
<p>The mouldering old tower here at Cockburnspath belonged to the
Earls of Home.&nbsp; Beautifully situated <a
name="page212"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 212</span>for preying
upon occasional travellers, the glen and the foaming torrent
below have no doubt received the bodies of many a one who in the
old days was rash enough to pass within sight of the old
tower.&nbsp; The comparatively modern bridge that takes a flying
leap across the ravine is the successor of an ancient one of
narrower span that still, covered with moss and ferns, arches
over the water, deep down in the hollow, and is popularly
supposed to be the oldest bridge in Scotland.&nbsp; A dense
tangle of red-berried rowan-trees, firs, and oaks overhangs the
gorge.&nbsp; Altogether a place that calls insistently to be
sketched and painted, but a place, from the military point of
view, to be wary of; being a position, as Cromwell in one of his
despatches says, &ldquo;where one man to hinder is better than
twelve to make way.&rdquo;&nbsp; It was at the &ldquo;strait pass
at Copperspath,&rdquo; as he calls it, that the great general,
writing after the battle of Dunbar, found plenty to hinder.</p>
<p>If ever general profited more by the mistakes of the enemy
than by his own tactical ability, it was Cromwell at this
juncture.&nbsp; The Scots under Leslie had cooped him up at
Dunbar, and, surrounded by the enemy, who occupied the heights
and closed every defile that led to a possible line of retreat,
he must, diseased and famishing as were his forces, have
capitulated, for the sea was at his back, and no help possible
from that direction.&nbsp; It was then that Leslie made his
disastrous move from the hills, and came down upon the English in
the levels of Broxburn, to the south of Dunbar town, where
Cromwell had his headquarters; and it was then that Cromwell,
seizing the moment when the enemy, coming down in a dense mass
upon a circumscribed space by Broxburn Glen, retrieved the
situation, and, directing a cavalry movement upon Leslie&rsquo;s
forces, had the supreme relief of seeing them broken up and
stamped into the earth by the furious charge of his
horsemen.&nbsp; The fragments of the Scottish army, routed with a
slaughter of three thousand, and ten thousand prisoners, fled,
and Cromwell&rsquo;s contemplated retreat to Berwick was no
longer a necessity.&nbsp; Indeed, the <a name="page214"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 214</span>whole of the Lowlands of Scotland
now lay open before him, and he entered Edinburgh with little
opposition.</p>

</a></p>
<p>It is a distance of nine miles between the village of
Cockburnspath and Dunbar, the road going parallel with the sea
all the way.&nbsp; First it goes dizzily over the profound rift
of Dunglass Dene, spanned at a height of a hundred and
twenty-five feet above the rocky bed of a mountain stream by the
bold arch of the railway viaduct and by the road bridge
itself.&nbsp; It is a scene of rare beauty, and the walk by the
zigzagging path among the thickets and the trees, down to where
the sea comes pounding furiously into a little cove, a quarter of
a mile below, wholly charming.&nbsp; Away out to sea is the
lowering bulk of the Bass Rock, a constant companion in the view
approaching Dunbar.</p>
<p>The direct road for Edinburgh avoids Dunbar altogether,
forking to the left at Broxburn where the battlefield lay, where
the burn still flows across the road as it did on the day of
&ldquo;Dunbar Drove,&rdquo; as Carlyle calls that dreadful
rout.&nbsp; Here &ldquo;the great road then as now crosses the
Burn of Brock. . . .&nbsp; Yes, my travelling friends,
vehiculating in gigs or otherwise over that piece of London road,
you may say to yourselves, Here, without monument, is the grave
of a valiant thing which was done under the Sun; the footprint of
a Hero, not yet quite indistinguishable, is here!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ahead, with its great red church on a hillock, still somewhat
apart of the south end of the town, is Dunbar, the first
characteristically Scottish place to which we come.&nbsp; It is
not possible to compete with Carlyle&rsquo;s masterly
word-picture of it, which presents the place before you with so
marvellous a fidelity to its spirit and
appearance:&mdash;&ldquo;The small town of Dunbar stands high and
windy, looking down over its herring-boats, over its grim old
castle, now much honeycombed, on one of those projecting
rock-promontories with which that shore of the Firth of Forth is
niched and vandyked as far as the eye can reach.&nbsp; A

his trade; <a name="page215"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

</a></p>
<p>Let us add some few details to the master&rsquo;s fine broad
handling; such as the fact that its streets are wondrously
cobble-stoned, that those whinstone rocks are red and give a
dull, blood-like coloration to the scene, and that the curious
old whitewashed Tolbooth in the High Street is the fullest
exemplar of the Scottish architectural style.&nbsp; Windy it is,
as Carlyle <a name="page216"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
216</span>says, and with a rawness in its air that calls forth
shivers from the Southron even in midsummer.&nbsp; Here the
stranger new to Scotland is apt to see for the first time the
sturdy fishwives and lasses who, still often with bare feet, go
along the streets carrying prodigiously weighty baskets of fish
on their backs, sometimes secured by a leather strap that goes
from the basket around the head and forehead!</p>
<p>One leaves Dunbar by wriggly and exiguous streets, coming
through the fisher villages of Belhaven and West Barns to where
the main avoiding route rejoins at Beltonford.&nbsp; The Scottish
Tyne winds through the flat meadows on the right&mdash;at such
fortunate times, that is to say, as when it does not pretend to
be an inland sea and take the meadows, the road, and the railway
for its province.&nbsp; The road, too, is flat, and the railway,
which hugs it closely, the same.&nbsp; A good road, too, and
beautiful.&nbsp; Midway of it, towards East Linton, are the
farmsteads and ricks of Phantassie, at which spot Rennie, the
engineer who built London Bridge, and heaven and Dr. Smiles alone
know how many harbours, was born in 1761.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Phantassie&rdquo; is a name that sorely piques one&rsquo;s
curiosity, so odd is it; but the group of farm-buildings is
commonplace enough, if more than commonly substantial.&nbsp; No
fantasy in their design, at any rate.</p>
<p>At East Linton we cross the Tyne which, crawling through the
meadows, plunges here in cascades under the road bridge, amid
confused rocks.&nbsp; The railway crosses it too, close by, and
spans the road beyond; and the village huddles together at an
angle of the way.&nbsp; A long ascent out of it commands wide
views of agricultural Haddingtonshire, and of that surprising
mountainous hill, Traprain Law, rising out of the plain to a
height of over seven hundred feet.</p>
<p>Not merely a surprising hill, but one with an astonishing
story.&nbsp; It had always been thought that treasure was buried
there, among the traces of ancient buildings; and accordingly,
with the permission of Right Honourable A. J. Balfour, on whose
land the <a name="page217"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
217</span>hill is situated, excavations were begun in 1919.&nbsp;
It was found that the hill-top had been inhabited intermittently
over remote periods, and diggings were made into successive
strata of hearths and floorings.&nbsp; At first the
&ldquo;finds&rdquo; were of minor articles: bronze ornaments,
glass and pottery, fragments of iron, mostly of Celtic origin,
but some Roman.&nbsp; The great discovery was made on May 12th,
1919, when a workman, driving a pick through a floor, brought up
a silver bowl on the point of it.&nbsp; A deep recess was then
discovered, filled with treasure: bowls, spoons, cups, saucers,
and a miscellaneous collection of plate, mostly cut to pieces in
strips folded over and hammered down into packets of
silver.&nbsp; Although it was grievous to look upon that
destruction, a good many of the fragments retained their original
decoration.&nbsp; They appear to be partly of Romano-Christian
origin, for the sacred symbol occurs among them, and on one piece
is the inscription &ldquo;Jesus Christus.&rdquo;&nbsp; Other
pieces are almost as certainly pagan, hearing as they do figures
of Pan and Hercules.&nbsp; Among them were four coins: the
earliest of the Emperor Valerius, whose reign began <span
class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 364, and the latest of Honorius, who
died <span class="GutSmall">A.D.</span> 463.&nbsp; A metal belt
of Saxon character was among this treasure-trove.</p>
<p>It appeared, therefore, that this hoard was a relic of one of
the sea-rovers&rsquo; raids on this coast in the fifth or sixth
century, and that the spoils had in some cases come from
plundered religious houses.&nbsp; The raiders were perhaps
disturbed in their activities, and buried their loot in the
expectation of returning for it at some more suitable time.</p>
<p>But they never returned.&nbsp; What happened to them is a vain
conjecture.&nbsp; They may have been found here and slain by some
stronger force, and perhaps they were lost at sea.&nbsp; In any
case, their hoard lay here for close upon one thousand five
hundred years.&nbsp; What they had hoped to carry away is now an
exhibit in the Scottish National Museum at Edinburgh.</p>
<p>To the north-going cyclist the road presently makes ample
amends for the mile-long rise, for, once topping it, <a
name="page218"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 218</span>a gentle
but continuous descent of four miles leads into Haddington, down
a road that for the most part could scarce be bettered, so
excellent its surface, so straight its course, and so beautifully
sylvan its surroundings.&nbsp; Hailes Castle is finely seen on
the left during this descent, its ruined walls and ivy-covered
towers wrapped three parts round with the thick woodlands that
clothe the lower slopes of Traprain Law.&nbsp; Mary, Queen of
Scots, and her evil spirit, the sinister Bothwell, had Hailes
Castle for their bower of love, and Wishart the martyr had a cell
in it for a prison, so that its present beauty of decay lacks
nothing of historic interest.</p>
<p>Nor does the fine mansion of Amisfield, through whose
park-like lands the road now descends.&nbsp; Amisfield has lurid
associations.&nbsp; Under the name of New Mills, it was in 1687
the scene of a dreadful parricide, and was at a later period
purchased by the infamous Colonel Francis Charteris, who might
aptly be termed (in Mr. Stead&rsquo;s phrase), the Minotaur of
his day.&nbsp; It was he who renamed it after the home of his
family in Nithsdale.&nbsp; As his exploits belong chiefly to
London, we, fortunately, need not enlarge upon them here.&nbsp;
The parricide already referred to was the murder of his father by
Philip Standsfield.&nbsp; Sir James Standsfield had set up a
cloth factory here, on the banks of the Tyne, and had done
remarkably well.&nbsp; He had two sons, Philip and John.&nbsp;
The eldest had been a scapegrace ever since that day when, as a
student at St. Andrews, he had gone to a meeting-house and flung
a loaf at the preacher.&nbsp; It took the astonished divine on
the side of the head and aroused within him the spirit of
prophecy.&nbsp; Addressing the crowded chapel at large (for the
loaf had been thrown unseen from some dark corner), he saw in a
vision the death of the culprit, at whose end there would be more
present than were hearing him that day; &ldquo;and the multitude
then present,&rdquo; adds the chronicler, &ldquo;was not
small.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Philip had a short and ignominious military career on the
Continent, and returned home to prey upon his <a
name="page219"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 219</span>father;
who, for sufficient reasons, disinherited him in favour of his
younger brother.&nbsp; In the end, aided by some servants, he
strangled the old man and threw the body in the river.&nbsp; For
this he was hanged at Edinburgh, and as the hanging was not
effectual, the executioner had to finish by strangling him, in
which public opinion of that time saw the neat handiwork of
Providence.</p>
<h2>XXXII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Here</span> begins Haddington, and here
end good roads for the space of a mile; and not until the burgh
is left behind do they recommence.&nbsp; The traveller who might
set out in quest of bad roads and vile paving would without
difficulty discover the objects of his search at
Haddington.&nbsp; He might conceivably find as bad elsewhere, but
worse examples would be miraculous indeed.&nbsp; We have
encountered many stretches of road, thus far, of a medi&aelig;val
quality, but the long road to the North boasts, or blushes for,
nothing nearly so craggy as are the cobble-stoned thoroughfares
of this &ldquo;royal burgh.&rdquo;&nbsp; The entrance to the town
from the south resembles, in its picturesque squalor, that to one
of the decayed towns of Brittany.&nbsp; Unswept, tatterdemalion
as it is, it still remains a fitting subject for the
artist&rsquo;s pencil, for here beside the narrow street stands
the rugged mass of Bothwell Castle, patched and clouted from time
to time, but happily as yet unrestored.&nbsp; Over the lintels of
old houses adjoining, still remain the pious invocations and
quaint devices originally sculptured there for the purpose of
averting the baleful glance of the Evil Eye.</p>
<p>The initial letter in the name of Haddington is a superfluity
and a misuse of the letter H, the name deriving from that of Ada,
Countess of Northumberland and ancestress of Scottish monarchs;
foundress also of a nunnery here which has long gone the way of
such medi&aelig;val things.&nbsp; The Tyne borders this town, and
<a name="page220"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
220</span>sometimes floods it, as may be readily seen by an
inscription on the wall of a house in High Street, which tells
how the water on October 4, 1775, suddenly rose eight feet and
three quarters.&nbsp; A curious legend, too, still survives,
recording a flood in 1358, when a nun of the pious Ada&rsquo;s
old foundation, seizing a statue of the Virgin out of its niche,
waded into the torrent and threatened to throw it in unless the
Blessed Mary instantly caused the waters to subside.&nbsp; That
they immediately did so appears to have been taken as evidence of
the effective moral suasion thus applied.</p>

<p>Haddington Abbey, the successor of earlier buildings, and now
itself partly ruined, stands by the inconstant river, the nave,
now the parish church, and the choir roofless, open to the
sky.&nbsp; It is here within these grass-grown walls that
&ldquo;Jane Welsh Carlyle, spouse of Thomas Carlyle, Chelsea,
London,&rdquo; lies, as the remorseful epitaph says,
&ldquo;suddenly snatched away from him, and the light of his life
as if gone out.&rdquo;&nbsp; The spot where the Abbey stands, by
the dishevelled and tumbledown quarter of Nungate, is the more
abject now in that it <a name="page221"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 221</span>still possesses old mansions that
tell of a more prosperous past.&nbsp; Here, on the river-bank,
neglected and forlorn like everything around, is the fine old
screen of the Bowling Green, where no one has, for a century
past, played bowls, unless indeed the wraiths of bygone Scottish
notables haunt the spot o&rsquo; nights and play ghostly games,
like the Kaatskill gnomes in <i>Rip Van Winkle</i>.&nbsp; It is
from the other side of the river that the Abbey is best seen, its
roofless central tower, the <i>Lucernia Laudoniae</i>, or
&ldquo;Lamp of Lothian,&rdquo; still showing those triple lancets
in every face which, according to the legend, obtained for it
that title.&nbsp; To obtain this view, the Abbey bridge is
crossed, which even now vividly illustrates on its wall the ready
way the old burgh had with malefactors.&nbsp; From it projects a
great hook, rusty for long want of usage, from which were hanged
the reivers, the horse-thieves, and casual evildoers, with
jurisdiction of the most summary kind.&nbsp; No Calcraft science
with it either, with neck broken in decent fashion, but just a
hauling up of the rope and a tying of it to some handy stanchion,
and the unhappy malefactor left to throttle by slow
degrees.&nbsp; No other such picturesque hanging-place as <a
name="page222"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 222</span>this, but
what is scenery to a criminal about to be hanged like a tom-cat
caught killing chickens.</p>

<p>The crest, arms, trade-mark or badge of Haddington is a
goat.&nbsp; There is no doubt about that, for Billy (or is it a
Nanny?) has his (or her) effigy on many of the old
buildings.&nbsp; Only by comparison and by slow degrees is it
that the stranger arrives at the conclusion that it is a goat,
for the drawing of many of these representations leaves much to
be desired.&nbsp; Some resemble an elephant, others a horse,
others yet what &ldquo;the mind&rsquo;s eye, Horatio&rdquo; might
conceive a Boojum to be like; but in the open space where High
Street and Market Street join, the modern Market Cross,
surmounted by a more carefully executed carving, determines the
species.</p>
<p>This is the centre of the town and neater than its entrance
from the south.&nbsp; The steepled classic building close by is
not a church but the Town House, masquerading in ecclesiastical
disguise, very much as Berwick&rsquo;s Town Hall does.&nbsp; From
this point it is only seventeen miles into Edinburgh; but in 1750
and for long after the coach journey employed the best efforts of
the local stage during the whole day.&nbsp; Musselburgh, little
more than eleven miles away, was reached in time for dinner, and
only when evening was come did the lumbering vehicle lurch into
its destination in Auld Reekie, when every one went to bed,
bruised and weary with the toils of the expedition.&nbsp; The
road at that time must have resembled the specimen of roadway
still adorning the south entrance to Haddington.</p>

<p>To-day, happily, it is in good condition as far as Levenhall,
seven miles short of our journey&rsquo;s end, whence it is bad
beyond the credibility of those who have not seen it.&nbsp;
Gladsmuir, Macmerry, and Tranent are interposed between; places
that sink their memories of the battle of Prestonpans in
iron-founding and coal-digging and suchlike, disregarding the
futilities of the Stuarts.&nbsp; As for Macmerry, whose name
prefigures orgies at the most of it, or sober revelry at the very
least, it is odds against your finding as depressing a place <a
name="page224"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 224</span>within a
hundred miles.&nbsp; If place-names were made to fit, why, then,
Macdolour might suit it to a marvel.&nbsp; Why?&nbsp; Just
because it stands at the crest of a barren knowe; an ugly row of
cottages on either side, with cinders and dust, clinkers and mud
in front of them, and some gaunt works within eyeshot.&nbsp; God
knows who christened the place, or if the name signified
merriment, but, if it did, either the scene has changed wholly
since then, or else he was a humorist of the sardonic sort who so
dubbed it.&nbsp; Tranent, too, a townlet subsisting upon
collieries: how grimly commonplace!&nbsp; But it at least has
this advantage, that from its elevated foothold it looks down
upon the Firth of Forth, that noble firth which Victor Hugo
blundered over so whimsically in rendering it as &ldquo;<i>la
Premi&eacute;re de la Quatri&egrave;me</i>.&rdquo;&nbsp; Seen
under the summer sun, how glorious that seaward view, with the
villages of Preston and Cockenzie, half hidden by their
woodlands, by the level shores.&nbsp; Half-way down from
Tranent&rsquo;s hillside you see a fine panorama: Arthur&rsquo;s
Seat in front, Calton Hill and its Nelson&rsquo;s column, peering
from behind, and the distant shores of Fife, with blowing
smoke-clouds, many miles away.&nbsp; Between Arthur&rsquo;s Seat
and the Calton, Edinburgh is hid, nine miles from this
point.&nbsp; Down in the levels in the mid-distance there are
hints of Musselburgh in smoke-wreaths and peeping towers; and
mayhap, while you gaze, the southward-bound train, with its white
puff of steam, is seen setting forth on its long journey
Londonwards.&nbsp; In these levels was fought the battle of
Prestonpans, Sunday, September 21, 1745, around that village of
Preston and those briny meads where the salt-pans used to be and
are no longer.</p>
<p>Preston&mdash;formerly Priest&rsquo;s Town&mdash;got its name
at the time when it was part of the celebrated Abbey of
Newbattle.&nbsp; The monks of that religious house were the first
discoverers of coal in Scotland, and also, in the twelfth
century, made this district the seat of a manufacture of
salt.&nbsp; Prestonpans, indeed, at one time supplied the whole
of the East Coast with salt, and it <a name="page225"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 225</span>was only on the repeal of the Salt
Duty that this old town fell into decay.&nbsp; Women, known as
salt-wives, a class almost as picturesque as the fish-wives of
Newhaven, used to carry the salt in creels on their backs, to
sell in Edinburgh and other towns.</p>
<p>In an orchard stands what was once the ancient village cross,
erected in 1617, in place of an earlier.&nbsp; Well-known as the
&ldquo;Chapmen&rsquo;s Cross,&rdquo; it was the meeting-place of
the chapmen, packmen, or pedlars of the Lothians.&nbsp; They
gathered early in July, transacted the business of their guild
and elected their &ldquo;King&rdquo; and his &ldquo;Lord
Deputy&rdquo; for the ensuing year.&nbsp; The
&ldquo;ink-bottle,&rdquo; cut in stone, into which they dipped
their pens, is still visible on the base of the cross.&nbsp; The
Bannatyne Club saved it from utter destruction, and instituted a
convivial guild, the &ldquo;Society of Chapmen of the
Lothians,&rdquo; visiting the cross every year, with Sir Walter
Scott as one of their members.</p>
<p>The world has vastly changed since &ldquo;the
Forty-five.&rdquo;&nbsp; It has, as a small detail, ceased to
produce its salt by evaporation of sea water; and, a larger and
more significant matter, no longer wages war for sake of
dynasties.&nbsp; The Highlanders who fought and gained this
fleeting victory for Prince Charlie were the last who drew the
sword for Romance and Right Divine.&nbsp; Prince Charlie had
moved out of his loyal Edinburgh at the approach of the English
under Sir John Cope, who, of course, in that fine foolish manner
of British officers, which will survive as long as the officers
themselves, wholly underrated his enemy.&nbsp; He was defeated
easily, with every circumstance of indignity, his soldiers
fleeing in abject terror before the impetuous charge of the
ferocious hairy-legged Highlanders, emerging, figures of
grotesque horror, out of the mists slowly dispersing off the
swampy fields in the laggard September sunrise.</p>
<p>The English numbered 2100 against the 1400 under Prince
Charlie; but only four minutes passed between the attack and the
flight.&nbsp; In that short space of time <a
name="page226"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 226</span>the field
was deserted and the clansmen, pursuing the terror-stricken
rabble which just before had been a disciplined force, slew
nearly four hundred of them.&nbsp; The total loss of the
Highlanders in slain was thirty, nearly the whole of them falling
in the first discharge of musketry.&nbsp; Almost incredible, but
well-authenticated, stories are told of the cowardice of
Cope&rsquo;s regiments.&nbsp; Cope himself was swept away in the
wild rush, vainly endeavouring to stem it, and it was not until
they were two miles from the field, at St. Clement&rsquo;s Wells,
that he could bring them to a halt.&nbsp; Even then, the
accidental discharge of a pistol scared them off again, and
although no one pursued, they rode off with redoubled
energy.&nbsp; This precipitate retreat of mounted troops over
miles of country, from an unmounted enemy who were not pursuing
them, is perhaps the most disgraceful incident in the military
history of the country.</p>
<p>The flying infantry were in far worse case.&nbsp; In
endeavouring to escape by climbing the park walls of Preston,
they were cut down in great numbers by the terrible broadswords
of the Highlanders.&nbsp; Colonel Gardiner and a brave few were
cut down defending themselves on the field of battle.&nbsp; One
story, of a piece with many others, relates how a Highlander,
pursuing alone a party of ten soldiers, struck down the
hindermost with his sword, and shouting, &ldquo;Down with your
arms!&rdquo; called upon the others to surrender.&nbsp; They
threw their weapons away without looking behind them, and the
Highlander, his sword in one hand and a pistol in the other,
drove them&mdash;nine of them!&mdash;prisoners into camp.&nbsp;
Everywhere Cope, so helter-skelter was his flight, himself
brought the first news of his defeat.&nbsp; He reached Coldstream
that night, and did not rest until the next day he was within the
sheltering fortifications of Berwick.</p>
<p>We will not further pursue the fortunes of the Young
Pretender, but hurry on into Levenhall.</p>
<p>Where that battle was fought, there is to-day the most
extensive cabbage-plant cultivation in Scotland.&nbsp; It is a
usual thing in the early part of the year for <a
name="page227"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 227</span>almost
daily special cabbage trains to be despatched to all parts of
Britain.</p>
<p>And so downhill, and then over the awful cobbles into the
accursed town of Musselburgh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Accursed,&rdquo; not
by reason of those self-same cobbles, but for the sacrilegious
doings of its magistrates who rebuilt their Tolbooth, burnt after
the battle of Pinkie, with stones from the Chapel of
Loretto.&nbsp; Now that chapel, which stood at the entrance to
the town, was the place of business of one of those roadside
hermits of whom we have in these pages heard so much (would that
he had a successor in these times, for then the road would
perhaps be in better condition), and the Pope, indignant at the
injury done to the wayside shrine, solemnly anathematised town
and inhabitants in sleeping or waking, eating and drinking, at
every conceivable time and every imaginable function.&nbsp; No
Pope since that period seems to have removed the curse, and no
one is particularly anxious that it should be removed,
Musselburgh being rather proud of it than otherwise.&nbsp; When
it begins to take effect will be quite time enough.&nbsp; There
were those who at the close of the coaching days perceived the
beginning of it, although then three hundred years overdue, but
as the town has rather increased in prosperity since that period,
the time evidently is not yet.&nbsp; Nor do the burghers
anticipate it, for they still repeat the brave old
rhyme:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>Musselburgh was a burgh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Edinburgh was nane;<br />
And Musselburgh shall be a burgh<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; When Edinburgh is gane.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This, however, is a quibble, for Musselburgh derived its name
from the &ldquo;broch,&rdquo; or bed, of mussels at the mouth of
the river Esk.&nbsp; Looked at in this light, the statement is
true enough and the prophecy a not particularly rash one.&nbsp;
The sponsorial shell-fish have an honoured place in the town
arms, in which three mussels are seen in company with three
anchors: the motto &ldquo;Honesty&rdquo; writ large below.&nbsp;
This was <a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>probably adopted at some period later than the
purloining of the stones of the Loretto Chapel.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<a href="images/p228.jpg">
<img alt=

</a></p>
<p>The Town Hall, with that tower whose building brought about
the curse, forms the centre of Musselburgh, a fishy, stony,
picturesque place with four bridges over the Esk, leading to the
western bank, where the fisher quarter of Fisherrow straggles
towards Joppa, two miles distant.&nbsp; Joppa Pans are gone now,
just as those other pans at Preston, but factories of sorts, with
clustered chimney-stacks, are still grouped about the melancholy
sea-shore, where gales set the very high-road awash on
occasion.&nbsp; Not vulgar, modern factories, but of a certain
age; old enough and grim enough to look like the scene of some
thrilling story that yet awaits the telling.&nbsp; Somewhat
thrilling is the report as to the condition of the road here in
1680, a complaint laid before the Privy Council stating that,
four miles on the London side of Edinburgh, travelling was
dangerous, and travellers to be pitied, &ldquo;either by their
coaches overturning, their horses falling, their carts breaking,
their loads casting, or horses stumbling, and the poor people
with burdens on their backs sorely discouraged; moreover,
strangers do often exclaim thereat.&rdquo;&nbsp; All this reads
with a very modern touch to <a name="page229"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 229</span>those who know the road to-day, for
it is as bad now as it could have been then, and so continues, in
different kinds of badness, through adjoining Portobello into
Edinburgh itself.&nbsp; Here seas of slimy mud, there precipitous
setts, here again profound holes in the macadam, or tramway rails
projecting above the road level, make these last miles
wretched.&nbsp; Portobello, that suburban seaside resort of
Edinburgh, fares in this respect no better than the rest of the
way, and the original road across Figgate Whins, the lonely moor
that was here before the first house of Portobello was built,
could have been no worse.&nbsp; That house was the creation of a
retired sailor who had been at the capture of Portobello in
Central America by Admiral Vernon in 1739.&nbsp; He named it
after that town, and when the present seaside resort began to
spring up, it took the title.&nbsp; Now it has a promenade, a
pier, hotels, and crowds of visitors in summer upon the sands,
and calls itself &ldquo;the Brighton of Scotland.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Observe that Brighton does not return the compliment, and has not
yet begun to style itself &ldquo;the Portobello of
England.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>XXXIII</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Leaving</span> the &ldquo;Brighton of
Scotland&rdquo; behind, we come to the flat lands of
Craigentinny, stretching away from the now suburban highway down
to the wind-swept and desolate seashore, where the whaups and the
sandpipers make mournful concerts in a minor key, to the
accompaniment of the noise of the sullen breakers and the
soughing of the wind amid the rustling bents.&nbsp; Overlooking
the road, within sight and sound of the tinkling tramcars passing
between Joppa, Portobello, and Edinburgh, is that singular
monument, &ldquo;Miller&rsquo;s Tomb.&rdquo;</p>
<p>William Henry Miller, whose remains lie beneath this pile of
classic architecture, was an antiquary and bibliophile, and
obtained his nickname of &ldquo;Measure <a
name="page230"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
230</span>Miller&rdquo; from his habit of measuring the margins
of the &ldquo;tall copies&rdquo; of the scarce books he
bought.&nbsp; His beardless face and shrill voice led to the
lifelong belief that he was really a woman.&nbsp; The tomb is
elaborately decorated with a carved marble frieze representing
the Song of Miriam and the destruction of the Egyptians in the
Red Sea.&nbsp; Miller and his father were both Quakers, and the
wealth of which they were possessed derived from a prosperous
seedsman&rsquo;s business in Canongate, Edinburgh.&nbsp; To the
father came an adventure which does not fall to many men.&nbsp;
He was married in 1789 for the third time, when nearly seventy
years of age, to an Englishwoman, who conveyed him against his
will in a post-chaise from Edinburgh to London.</p>
<p>Passing Craigentinny and Jock&rsquo;s Lodge we are, in the
words of the old song, &ldquo;Within a mile of Edinburgh
town.&rdquo;&nbsp; The more modern and acceptable name of
Jock&rsquo;s Lodge is Piershill, but it has been known by the
other for over two hundred and seventy years.&nbsp; Who the
original Jock was seems open to doubt, but he is supposed to have
been a beggar who built himself a hut on this then lonely road
leading to Figgate Whins.&nbsp; Even in 1650, when Cromwell
besieged Edinburgh, the spot had obtained its name, and is
referred to as &ldquo;that place called Jockis
Lodge.&rdquo;&nbsp; Towards the close of the eighteenth century a
Colonel Piers had a villa here, pulled down in 1793, when
barracks&mdash;known as Piershill Barracks&mdash;were built on
the site.&nbsp; It is a district slowly emerging from the
reproach of a disreputable past, when footpads and murderers
haunted the muddy roads, or took refuge amid the towering rocks
of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat, Crow Hill, or Salisbury Craigs, or hid in
the congenial sloughs of the Hunter&rsquo;s Bog.&nbsp; Close by
the road, at the entrance to the Queen&rsquo;s Park of Holyrood,
is Muschat&rsquo;s Cairn, the place where Scott makes Jeanie
Deans meet the outlaw Robertson.&nbsp; This heap of stones marks
the spot where Nicol Muschat of Boghall, a surgeon, a man of
infamous character, murdered his wife by cutting her throat in
1720, a crime which, with Scottish old-time mysticism, he said <a
name="page231"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 231</span>was
committed by direct personal instigation of the devil.&nbsp; All
the same, they hanged him for it in the Grassmarket, where
martyrs &ldquo;testified&rdquo; of old and the criminals of
&ldquo;Auld Reekie&rdquo; expiated their crimes.</p>
<p>Of course the approach to Edinburgh has, from the picturesque
standpoint, been spoiled.&nbsp; Ranges of grim stone houses and
sprawling suburbs now hem in the road and hide the view of
Arthur&rsquo;s Seat and its neighbouring eminences; but a few
steps to the left serve to disclose them, the little loch of St.
Margaret, and the ruined walls of St. Anthony&rsquo;s Chapel on
the hillside, once guarding the holy well.&nbsp; St.
Anthony&rsquo;s Chapel, within the rule of the Abbey of Holyrood,
served another turn, for from its tower glimmered a beacon which
in the old days guided mariners safely up the Forth, a service
paid for out of the harbour dues.</p>
<p>The so-called &ldquo;London&rdquo; and &ldquo;Regent&rdquo;
Roads that now lead directly into the New Town of Edinburgh are
modern improvements upon the old approach through Canongate into
the Old Town.&nbsp; If steep, rugged, and winding, the old way
was at least more impressive, for it lay within sight of Holyrood
Palace and brought the wayfarer into the very heart of
Scott&rsquo;s &ldquo;own romantic town,&rdquo; to where the
smells and the dirt, the crazy tenement-houses and the ragged
clouts hanging from dizzy tiers of windows, showed
&ldquo;Scotia&rsquo;s darling seat&rdquo; in its most
characteristic aspects.</p>
<p>As Alexander Smith puts it, Scott discovered the city was
beautiful, sang its praises to the world, &ldquo;and he has put
more coin into the pockets of its inhabitants than if he had
established a branch of manufacture of which they had the
monopoly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The distant view of Edinburgh is magnificent.&nbsp; The peaked
and jagged masses of Arthur&rsquo;s Seat and Salisbury Craigs,
the monument-cumbered Calton Hill, the Castle Rock&mdash;all
these combine to make the traveller eager to reach so picturesque
a spot.&nbsp; Approaching it and seeing the smoke-cloud drifting
with the breeze away from the hollow from which Edinburgh&rsquo;s
million chimneys are seen peering, one <a
name="page232"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 232</span>instantly
notes the peculiar appropriateness of the Scots endearing
epithet, &ldquo;Auld Reekie.&rdquo;&nbsp; But it was not
only&mdash;if indeed at all&mdash;an admiration of the
picturesque that made the sight of Edinburgh so welcome to
old-time travellers.&nbsp; It was rather the prospect of coming
to the end of their journey, and almost in sight of a comfortable
hotel, that rendered the view so welcome to those who in the last
thirty years or so of the coaching era made this trip of almost
four hundred miles; but those who had come this way at an earlier
period had no such comfortable prospect before them.&nbsp;
Instead of putting up at some fine hospitable inn, such as they
were used to even in the smaller English towns, they were set
down at a &ldquo;stabler&rsquo;s,&rdquo; the premises of one
whose first business was to horse the coaches and to let
saddle-horses, and who, as in some sort of an after-thought,
lodged those who were obliged to journey about the country.</p>

<p><a name="page233"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 233</span>A
traveller arriving at Edinburgh in 1774, for instance, had indeed
little comfort awaiting him.&nbsp; &ldquo;One can scarcely form
in imagination the distress of a miserable stranger on his first
entrance into this city,&rdquo; says one writing at this
period.&nbsp; No inn better than an alehouse, no decent or
cleanly accommodation, nor in fact anything fit for a
gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;On my first arrival,&rdquo; says this
traveller, &ldquo;my companion and self, after the fatigue of a
long day&rsquo;s journey, were landed at one of these
stable-keepers&rsquo; (for they have modesty to give themselves
no higher denomination) in a part of the town which is called the
Pleasance; and on entering the house we were conducted by a poor
girl without shoes or stockings, and with only a single
linsey-woolsey petticoat which just reached half-way to her
ankles, into a room where about twenty Scotch drovers had been
regaling themselves with whisky and potatoes.&nbsp; You may guess
our amazement when we were informed that this was the best inn in
the metropolis, and that we could have no beds unless we had an
inclination to sleep together, and in the same room with the
company which a stage-coach had that moment discharged.&nbsp;
&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I to my friend, &lsquo;there is nothing
like seeing men and manners; perhaps we may be able to repose
ourselves at some coffee-house.&rsquo;&nbsp; Accordingly, on
inquiry, we discovered that there was a good dame by the Cross
who acted in the double capacity of pouring out coffee and
letting lodgings to strangers, as we were.&nbsp; She was easily
to be found out, and, with all the conciliating complaisance of a
<i>Maitresse d&rsquo;H&ocirc;tel</i>, conducted us to our
destined apartments, which were indeed six stories high, but so
infernal in appearance that you would have thought yourself in
the regions of Erebus.&nbsp; The truth is, I will venture to say,
you will make no scruple to believe when I tell you that in the
whole we had only two windows, which looked into an alley five
feet wide, where the houses were at least ten stories high and
the alley itself was so sombre in the brightest sunshine that it
was impossible to see any object distinctly.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page234"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
234</span>Private lodgings, just as those described above, were
the resort of those who had neither friends nor acquaintance in
Edinburgh at that time; but travellers in Scotland were nearly
always exercising their ingenuity to come, at the end of their
day&rsquo;s journey, to the house of some friend or some
friend&rsquo;s friend, to whom before starting they had been
careful to obtain letters of introduction.&nbsp; So old and so
widespread a custom was this that, so far back as 1425, we find
an Act of James the First of Scotland actually forbidding all
travellers resorting to burgh towns to lodge with friends or
acquaintances, or in any place but the
&ldquo;hostillaries,&rdquo; unless indeed he was a personage of
consequence, with a great retinue, in which case he might accept
a friend&rsquo;s hospitality, provided that his &ldquo;horse and
meinze&rdquo; were sent to the inns.</p>
<p>Of course such an Act was doomed to fall into neglect, but the
innkeepers, equally of course during a long series of years,
almost ceased to exist.&nbsp; A few &ldquo;stablers&rsquo;&rdquo;
establishments became known as &ldquo;inns&rdquo; at about the
period of Doctor Johnson&rsquo;s visit to Edinburgh.&nbsp; They
were chiefly situated in the Pleasance, or in that continuation
of it, St. Mary&rsquo;s Wynd (now St. Mary Street).&nbsp; These
inns, such as they were, burst upon the by no means delighted
gaze of the wayfarer from England as he entered the historic town
of Edinburgh, and when he saw them he generally lifted up his
voice and cursed the fate that had sent him so far from home and
into so barbarous a country.</p>
<p>The Pleasance was largely in receipt of the traffic to and
from the south until the construction of the North and South
Bridges, opened in 1769 and 1788, diverted it to a higher
level.&nbsp; We may look in vain nowadays in the Pleasance for
the inns of that day.&nbsp; They are demolished and altered so
greatly as to be unrecognisable; but the &ldquo;White
Horse,&rdquo; which stands in a court away down Canongate, will
give us an idea of the kind of place.&nbsp; Situated in
&ldquo;White Horse,&rdquo; or Davison&rsquo;s Close in Canongate,
and reached from that street by a low-browed archway, it remains
a <a name="page235"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
235</span>perfect example of the Edinburgh inn of nearly three
hundred years ago.&nbsp; An inn no longer, but occupied in
tenements, the internal arrangements are somewhat altered, but
the time when the house extended a primitive hospitality to
travellers is not difficult to reconstruct in the
imagination.&nbsp; To it, at the end of their journeys, came
those wearied ones, to find accommodation of the most intimate
and domestic kind.&nbsp; Kitchen and dining-room were one, and it
was scarce possible for a guest to obtain a bedroom to
himself.&nbsp; Dirt was accepted as inevitable.&nbsp; In fact,
the modern &ldquo;dosser&rdquo; is better and more decently
housed.&nbsp; To the &ldquo;White Horse&rdquo; came
others&mdash;those about to set out upon their travels.&nbsp;
Booted and spurred, wills made and saddle-bags packed, they
resorted hither to hire horses for their journeys, and it is not
unlikely that the old house saw in early times many a quaking
laird, badly wanted by the <a name="page236"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 236</span>Government, slinking through the
archway from the Canongate, to secure trusty mounts for instant
flight.&nbsp; Scott, indeed, has made it the scene of strange
doings in his <i>Waverley</i>.</p>

</a></p>
<p>This is the oldest house in Edinburgh ever used as an inn, but
must not be confused with that other &ldquo;White Horse,&rdquo;
long since demolished, made famous by Doctor Johnson.</p>
<p>It was in 1773 that Johnson reached Edinburgh.&nbsp; He put up
at the &ldquo;White Horse&rdquo; in Boyd&rsquo;s Close, called,
even in those uncleanly times, &ldquo;that dirty and
dismal&rdquo; inn, kept by James Boyd.&nbsp; The great man
immediately notified his arrival to Boswell in this short
note:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Saturday night</i>.&mdash;Mr. Johnson sends his
compliments to Mr. Boswell, being just arrived at
Boyd&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Boswell arrived, falling over himself in his eagerness,
he found the Doctor furiously angry.&nbsp; Doubtless he had been
conducted to his room, as was not unusually the case, by some
dirty sunburnt wench, without shoes or stockings, a fit object
for dislike; but the chief cause of his anger was the waiter, who
had sweetened his lemonade without the ceremony of using the
sugar-tongs.&nbsp; He threw the lemonade out of window, and
seemed inclined to throw the waiter after it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peter Ramsay&rsquo;s&rdquo; was a famous inn, situated
at the foot of St. Mary&rsquo;s Wynd, next the Cowgate
Port.&nbsp; To it came travellers along both the east and the
south roads.&nbsp; Ramsay advertised it in 1776 as being &ldquo;a
good house for entertainment, good stables for above one hundred
horses, and sheds for about twenty carriages.&rdquo;&nbsp; In
1790, he retired with a fortune of &pound;10,000.&nbsp; But in
the best of these old Edinburgh inns the beds well merited a
description given of them as &ldquo;dish-clouts stretched on
grid-irons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>First among the innkeepers of this unsanctified quarter to
remove from it into the New Town was James Dun.&nbsp; He was a
man notable among his kind, having not only been the first to
call himself an <a name="page237"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
237</span>&ldquo;innkeeper&rdquo; instead of a
&ldquo;stabler,&rdquo; but the greatly daring person who first
used the outlandish word &ldquo;Hotel&rdquo; in Edinburgh.&nbsp;
He began &ldquo;hotel&rdquo;-keeping in the flats above the
haberdashery shop of John Neale, who, two years before, in 1774,
had built the first house in the New Town.&nbsp; Neale himself
was a pioneer of considerable nerve, for although the New Town
had been projected and building-sites laid out on what is now the
chief ornament of it, Princes Street, prospective tenants were
shy of so bleak and exposed a situation as this then was.&nbsp;
They preferred to live in the dirty cosiness of the old wynds and
closes, and so the New Town seemed likely to be a paper project
for years to come.&nbsp; At this juncture the Town Council made a
sporting offer of exemption from all local taxes for the first
who would build a house there.&nbsp; Neale was this pioneer, and
he built the house that still stands next the Register House, the
most easterly house in Princes Street.</p>
<p>Dun, to whom he had let the upper part, immediately displayed
a great gilded sign, &ldquo;Dun&rsquo;s Hotel,&rdquo; whereupon
the Lord Provost, representing public feeling, wrote objecting to
the foreign word &ldquo;Hotel,&rdquo; saying that, whatever might
be the real character of his establishment, he might at least
avoid the scandalous indecency of publicly proclaiming it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">These</span> concluding pages of a book on

</a>The modern traveller by road, coming in by the London Road,
Greenside, Leith Street, and Princes Street, comes in by the New
Town, and sees on his <a name="page238"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 238</span>left, across a deep ravine, partly
occupied by a huge railway station and partly by beautiful public
gardens, the dark mass of the Castle and the Old Town crowning
the opposite heights, grey and stern, in effective contrast with
the gay flower-beds down below, the old houses huddling together
on the scanty foothold of the ridge and rising to sheer
heights.&nbsp; <i>That</i> is the original historic town:
<i>this</i>, to which the modern traveller comes by road, the
new.&nbsp; Little more than a hundred years ago this New Town was
not thought of: its site the meadows and wastes that sloped down
to the Firth of Forth and the sea, and the site of the railway
station and the Princes Street Gardens covered with the dark
waters of the Nor&rsquo; Loch.</p>
<p>Old-time arrivals in Edinburgh, coming in by Canongate, found
themselves in midst of squalor and picturesqueness; and <a
name="page239"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 239</span>although
much of the picturesque is gone, it is still a quaint street and
the squalor survives.&nbsp; The poor who live here &ldquo;hang
forth their banners from the outward walls,&rdquo; in the shape
of their domestic washing, fluttering in the breeze from every
window, at the end of long poles, and how poor they are may be
judged from the condition of the clothes they consider worth
keeping.&nbsp; That sometime prison, the Canongate Tolbooth,
facing the long street, remains one of the most curious relics of
Edinburgh&rsquo;s past.&nbsp; <a name="page240"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 240</span>Not a very ancient past, for it was
only &ldquo;biggit&rdquo; in 1591, but old enough to be regarded
with reverence, and quaint to admiration, with its spired tower
and tourelles, so eminently Scotch of that period when the French
influence in architecture was yet strong.&nbsp; You can match
those curious spires time and time again among the old
ch&acirc;teaux of the Loire, and in Brittany; just as in the old
Norman town of Coutances one can find the counterpart of the old
theatre in Playhouse Close, near by.</p>

<p>From here, those travellers saw the Old Town ahead and,
progressing up High Street, came successively to the Tron Church,
the Market Cross, St. Giles&rsquo;s Cathedral, and, before
1817&mdash;when it was pulled down&mdash;to the Old
Tolbooth.&nbsp; Beyond this, the Lawnmarket conducted to the
Castle, which then marked the end of the town.&nbsp; In this
progress the tall and crowded houses and darkening wynds and
closes stood to right and left.&nbsp; Later years have seen the
disappearance of many of these places, where in old times the
ferocious Scots nobles lived, poor and proud, bloodthirsty and
superstitious, but those that are left are very grim, dark, and
dirty, and the ten-and eleven-storied houses of such a height
that only by great exertions is it possible to crane the neck and
lift the eyes to the skyline, against which the belching chimneys
of the piled-up &ldquo;lands&rdquo; are projecting the smoke of
domestic hearths and eternally justifying the old Scots term of
endearment for Edinburgh.&nbsp; The nobles are gone, lang syne,
their old dens occupied now by the very poorest of
Edinburgh&rsquo;s poor; but sanitary conditions, even with the
present occupants, are not so degraded as they were when the
flower of Scotland&rsquo;s nobility dwelt here; when pigs and
fowls were herded in the basements, or ran unheeded in the
alleys, and wayfarers skulked under the walls at the sound of
voices above, calling &ldquo;gardy-loo&rdquo;&mdash;a call which
accompanied a discharge of overflowing household utensils from
inconceivable heights into the gutters below.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gardy-loo&rdquo; was a term which, with <a
name="page241"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 241</span>this
dreadfully unclean custom, derived from France, having been
originally <i>gardez-l&rsquo;eau</i>; just as the cakes sold at
Craigmillar, called &ldquo;petticoat tails&rdquo; were originally
<i>petits gateaux</i>.</p>
<p>Still, the Old Town is sufficiently grimy and huddled yet to
fitly illustrate the Scottish saying &ldquo;The clartier
(<i>i.e.</i> the dirtier) the cosier.&rdquo;</p>

</a></p>
<p>Nothing is more characteristic of the Old Town than the
religious texts carved upon the stone door lintels of these
ancient houses.&nbsp; Few are without them.&nbsp; To a stranger
they would seem to tell of a fervent piety, but they meant more
than that.&nbsp; They were always accompanied with a date and
with the initials&mdash;sometimes also the arms&mdash;of their
owners; as in the beautiful example still remaining in Lady
Stair&rsquo;s Close, and represented both pride and a fearful
superstition.&nbsp; Superstition, because the improving texts and
pious ejaculations meant little beyond talismanic protection
against &ldquo;Auld Hornie,&rdquo; wizards, and warlocks,
wehr-wolves, and all those frightful inhabitants of Satan&rsquo;s
invisible world in which the Scotch most fervently believed, from
king to peasant.&nbsp; Thus when we read over one of these old
doorways the queerly spelled</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Blissit be God in all
His giftis,</p>
</blockquote>
<p>we know that this was little less than an incantation, and
marked a lively sense of favours to come; and when our eye lights
upon the inscription next door,</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">Pax intrantibus: Salus
exevntibvs,</p>
</blockquote>
<p><a name="page242"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 242</span>we
know that the good feeling thus prominently displayed would by no
means have prevented the fierce lord of the house from stabbing
his guest in a dark corner, if he had a mind to it.</p>

</a>A highly interesting book might be written on these old
sculptured stones alone.&nbsp; Nor are they in every instance
old.&nbsp; Some modern ones exist, and the entirely laudable
passion for commemoration has caused interesting tablets to be
set up, marking many of Edinburgh&rsquo;s famous spots.&nbsp; A
curious modern piece of sculpture decorates more or less
artistically the archway leading from the High Street into
Paisley Close, supporting a tall building erected in 1862.&nbsp;
It represents the bust of a boy, and includes an inscribed
label.&nbsp; It seems that the old building standing on this site
suddenly collapsed on a Sunday morning in 1861, and buried a
number of people in the ruins, thirty-five actually dying from
their injuries.&nbsp; Some were fortunate enough to be screened
from the heavy masses of stone and brick by timbers which in
falling had imprisoned them.&nbsp; Among these was the lad whose
face is represented in the carving.&nbsp; The rescuers who came
with pick and shovel to dig out the survivors had succoured many,
and were turning back when they heard the muffled cry,
&ldquo;Heave awa, lads, I&rsquo;m no&rsquo; deid yet,&rdquo; and
redoubling their efforts, extricated the author of it.</p>
<p>No relic now remains upon the door-posts of these old houses
of the curious contrivance which preceded the door-knocker, and
for the sight of a &ldquo;tirle-pin&rdquo; the stranger must
needs go to the museum of the Royal Scottish Society of
Antiquaries, to which the last <a name="page243"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 243</span>example was long since removed, from
an old house in the Canongate.</p>

<a href="images/p243.jpg">
<img class='floatright' alt=
"A Tirle-Pin"
title=
"A Tirle-Pin"
 src="images/p243.jpg" />
</a>The tirle-pin had a variety of names.&nbsp; Sometimes it
would be called a &ldquo;risp&rdquo; or a &ldquo;ringle,&rdquo;
and there were those who knew it as a &ldquo;craw&rdquo;; that is
to say, a crow, from the harsh crow-like sound produced by its
use.&nbsp; A tirle-pin was just a rasping contrivance made of a
twisted bar of iron fixed against the door post with an iron ring
hanging loosely from it, as in the accompanying sketch.&nbsp;
Instead of knocking, one who desired admittance would seize the
ring and rasp it up and down the twisted iron, producing a noise
which could be distinctly heard within.</p>
<p>The origin of the tirle-pin, like that of many another
Scottish custom, was French.&nbsp; It originated in France in the
times of the Valois, in days when it was not etiquette to knock
at the doors of royal personages.&nbsp; In face of this,
courtiers were reduced to scratching with the
finger-nails&mdash;a disagreeable sensation when practised upon
wood, as any one who tries it may readily discover for
himself.&nbsp; Perhaps from this cause, or because the scratching
was not loud enough (or, perhaps, even because the polish began
to disappear from the royal portals) this mechanical scratcher
was invented.&nbsp; The fashion spread from France to Scotland in
times when the two countries were linked in close ties of
friendship.&nbsp; From the palace it spread down to the mansions
of the nobles and the houses of the merchants, finally coming
into general use.&nbsp; It was never acclimatised in England,
although another kind of scratching was, if we may believe the
satirists, who say that James the First and his Scottish
followers imported the itch.</p>
<p>However, the tirle-pin is obsolete, but it did not disappear
without leaving a trace of its existence in <a
name="page244"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 244</span>old Scots
ballads; as, for instance, that of <i>Sweet William&rsquo;s
Ghaist</i>:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>There cam a ghaist to Margaret&rsquo;s door,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wi&rsquo; mony a grievous groan;<br />
And aye he tirled upon the pinne,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; But answer made she nane.</p>
<p>Is that my father Philip?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Or is&rsquo;t my brother John,<br />
Or is&rsquo;t my true love Willie<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To Scotland now come home?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A <span class="smcap">grim</span> old town, Edinburgh,
dominated by the ancient castle from its rock, bodeful with the
story of a thousand years.&nbsp; Newer new towns have sprung up
around it to south and west, and hem the old fortress in with a
bordure of unhistoric suburbs, so that from the topmost
battlements you see how small the original Edinburgh is, compared
with its surroundings.&nbsp; Places of pilgrimage are not lacking
in the old streets.&nbsp; There are John Knox&rsquo;s house, one
of the queerest, three-storied, and gabled, the very ideal of
rugged strength; and the Parliament Square, once St.
Giles&rsquo;s churchyard, where &ldquo;I K 1572,&rdquo; on a
stone in the pavement, marks the site of Knox&rsquo;s
grave.&nbsp; Passers-by walk over it, curiously fulfilling
Johnson&rsquo;s aspiration, made years before the churchyard was
destroyed, by which he hoped that the dour Presbyterian was
buried on a highway.&nbsp; While we are on the subject of tombs,
let us mention that other place of pilgrimage, Greyfriars
churchyard, that grisly place where Robert Louis Stevenson was
accustomed in his youth to make assignations with
parlour-maids.&nbsp; Few places so grim as a Scottish
burial-ground, and Greyfriars is of these the grimmest.&nbsp;
Dishevelled backs of houses look down upon the mouldering tombs,
and kitchens and living-rooms open into the houses of the
dead.&nbsp; Rusty iron railings, bolts and bars, guard the
blackened and broken mausoleums and give the pilgrim the weird <a
name="page245"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 245</span>idea that
the living have taken extraordinary precautions to imprison those
who are never likely to break out.&nbsp; The only living things
here are the foul grass that grows within the sepulchral
enclosures, and the <a name="page246"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 246</span>demon cats of an heraldic slimness
that haunt the churchyard in incredible numbers, and stealing
victuals from the neighbouring houses, gnaw them within the
tombs.&nbsp; Many martyrs for religion have their resting-place
here, together with those who martyred them.&nbsp; Persecutors
and persecuted alike rest here now.</p>

<p>Sympathies will ever be divided between the Covenanters and
their oppressors.&nbsp; As you read how they upheld their faith
and signed their names to the Covenant in this gruesome yard of
Greyfriars, so ominously on that flat tombstone which even now
remains, you are fired with an enthusiasm for those rejecters of
a liturgy alien from their convictions, and can curse
&ldquo;Claverse&rdquo; with the best of those who do not forget
the heavy ways of &ldquo;bonnie Dundee&rdquo; with them.&nbsp;
But the Covenanters were as intolerant with those when they came
to rule.&nbsp; The men of both sides were men of blood.&nbsp; The
strain of intolerance remains, and the tomb of that other
persecutor of the Covenanters, Sir George Mackenzie, has always
been, and still is, with the people &ldquo;bloody
Mackenzie&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Old Edinburgh life centred at the Market Cross, happily
restored in 1885 by Mr. Gladstone.&nbsp; The Cross has had a
troubled history.&nbsp; Reconstructed from a much older one in
1617, it remained here until 1756, when the
&ldquo;improving&rdquo; fanatics of that time swept the historic
structure away, without a thought of the associations belonging
to it.&nbsp; They were associations of every kind.&nbsp; Kings
had been proclaimed at it by heralds with fanfare of trumpet;
patriots and traitors with equal contumely had been done to death
beside it; and the continual round of punishments which gave the
common hangman a busy time were inflicted here.&nbsp; In fact,
were a rogue to be pilloried or a king&rsquo;s birthday to be
kept with becoming ceremony, the Cross was the place.&nbsp; Let
us see what those punishments were like, from one example
illustrative of the general run of them.&nbsp; Here is what they
did in 1655 to &ldquo;Mr. Patrik Maxwell, ane arrant
decevar.&rdquo;&nbsp; They brought him here &ldquo;quhair a
pillorie was erectit, gairdit and convoyed <a

gevin out fals calumneis and leyis aganes Collonell Daniell,
governour of Peirth.&nbsp; Bot the treuth is, he was ane
notorious decevar and ane intelligencer, sumtyme for the
Englesches, uther tymes for the Scottis, and decevand both of
thame: besyde mony prankis quhilk wer tedious to
writt.&rdquo;&nbsp; Quite so; but if all deceivers had their ears
cut off, how few would retain them!&nbsp; A ferocious folk, those
old Scots, and petty delinquents supped sorrow at their hands
with a big spoon.&nbsp; Sorry the lot of scandal-mongers and the
like, seated on a wooden horse with hands and legs tied, and
permission freely accorded to all for the throwing of
missiles.&nbsp; Ferocity, however, should go hand in hand with
courage&mdash;a quality apparently not possessed by the citizens
of Edinburgh when Prince Charlie and his Highlanders came, in
1745.&nbsp; Incredulous of the wild clansmen ever daring to
attack the town, they laughed at the very idea; but when they
heard of his small force having eluded the force of Johnny Cope,
sent to intercept them, and advancing in earnest, things took a
very different colour.&nbsp; Those who were loyal to the House of
Hanover were quaking in their shoes, and the Jacobites
rejoicing.&nbsp; The city armed, even to the <a
name="page248"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 248</span>clergymen,
who, on the Sunday before the surrender, preached in the churches
with swords and daggers buckled on under their gowns.&nbsp; Bands
of volunteers were raised, and on the report that the Pretender
was near, were marched outside the walls to dispute his entry,
despite their murmurs that they had volunteered to defend the
city from the inside, and were not prepared to go out to be cut
to pieces with the invaders&rsquo; claymores.&nbsp; Captain
ex-Provost Drummond marched with his company down the West Bow
towards the West Port.&nbsp; Looking round when he had reached
it, he to his astonishment found himself alone.&nbsp; The
volunteers had vanished down the back lanes or closes!&nbsp; But
the dragoons were as bad.&nbsp; Coming near the enemy at
Corstorphine, two miles out, they bolted without firing a shot,
and so back into Edinburgh and through it and out at the other
end.&nbsp; It was the ferocious appearance of the Highlanders
that caused this terror.&nbsp; They were comparatively few;
ill-armed, ragged, and ill-fed.&nbsp; But their strange dress,
their wild looks, shaggy locks, and generally outlandish
appearance, frightened the good Lowlanders, who knew almost as
little of these Gaelic tribes as Londoners themselves.&nbsp; The
old-time warfare of the Japanese and the Chinese, with their
hideous masks; the dismal tom-toming of the African savage; the
war-paint of the Red Indian, are justified of their existence,
for the strange and hideous in warfare is very effective in
striking a paralysing terror into an enemy.&nbsp; Accordingly,
the tartans, the naked legs and arms, and the uncombed locks of
the lairds&rsquo; uncivilised levies captured Edinburgh for
Prince Charlie, who, a few days later, September 17, caused his
father, the Old Pretender, to be proclaimed king, by the title of
James the Third, at the Cross.</p>

</a>With the suppression of &ldquo;the Forty-five,&rdquo; the
stirring warlike story of Edinburgh came to an end; but not until
1807, when the Edinburgh police came into existence, was the
semi-military Town Guard, raised in 1682, abolished.&nbsp; The
Town Guard and the townspeople <a name="page250"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 250</span>were always at odds, and hated one
another cordially.&nbsp; Recruited from the army, and armed with
the formidable weapons called &ldquo;Jeddart axes,&rdquo; it was
originally a fine body, designed rather to keep the town in order
than to protect it, and its members never lost sight of that
fact.&nbsp; In its last years, however, the Town Guard declined
in importance and in numbers, and, coming to be regarded as a
refuge for old pensioners who could scarcely manage to crawl
about, became an object of derision.&nbsp; Then the sins of their
forerunners were visited upon the heads of those unhappy old men,
and it became a common sight to see them baited by mischievous
small boys.&nbsp; The last of the Town Guard tottered about
Parliament Square in his queer uniform and three-cornered hat,
hardly able to shoulder his axe, and regarded by the inhabitants
as one of their most genuine antiquities, until he too followed
his comrades to the tomb.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">One</span> must needs admire
Edinburgh.&nbsp; You may have seen the noblest cities of the
world; have stood upon the Acropolis at Athens, on the Heights of
Abraham at Quebec; have viewed Rome and her seven hills, or
Constantinople from the Golden Horn; but Edinburgh still retains
her pride of place, even in the eyes of the much travelled.&nbsp;
You need not be Scottish to feel the charm of her, and can
readily understand why she means so much to the Scot; but your
gorge rises at the immemorial dirt of the Old Town,
simultaneously <a name="page253"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
253</span>with your admiration of its wondrous picturesqueness,
and stately Princes Street seems to you a revelation of
magnificence even while the bulk of the New Town appears grey,
formal, and forbidding.&nbsp; The great gulf fixed between Old
Town and New, that ravine in which the railway burrows, and on
whose banks the Princes Street Gardens run, renders that
thoroughfare, with its one side of grass and trees and the other
of fine shops and towering houses, reminiscent to the Londoner of
Piccadilly.&nbsp; But Piccadilly has not a towering Castle on one
side of it, nor a Calton Hill at the end; nor, on the other hand,
does Piccadilly know such easterly blasts as those that sweep
down the long length of Princes Street and freeze the very marrow
of the Southerner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same isothermal line,&rdquo; wrote Robert Chambers,
&ldquo;passes through Edinburgh and London.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; James Payn used to say, &ldquo;I never knew
of a four-wheeled cab being blown over by an east wind in London,
as has just happened in Edinburgh,&rdquo; and R.L.S. tells us
frankly that his native city has &ldquo;the vilest climate under
heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Princes Street is perhaps even more like the Brighton Front in
its well-dressed crowds and fine shops.&nbsp; With the sea in
place of the Gardens and the Castle, the resemblance would be
singularly close.</p>
<p>As for Calton Hill, that neo-classic eminence gives form and
substance to Edinburgh&rsquo;s claim to be the &ldquo;Modern
Athens.&rdquo;&nbsp; Learning had not been unknown in the Old
Town, where Hume and Boswell wrote; but, given air and
elbow-room, it expanded vastly when the New Town was planned, and
with the dawn of the nineteenth century, literature flourished
exceedingly.&nbsp; This seems to have inspired the idea of
emulating the capital of Greece, to the eye as well as to the
mind.&nbsp; Accordingly a copy of the Parthenon was begun on the
crest of Calton Hill, as a monument to the Scots soldiers who
fell in the campaigns against Napoleon.&nbsp; It cost a huge sum
and has never been completed, and so it has familiarly been
called <a name="page254"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
254</span>&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Folly&rdquo; and
&ldquo;Scotland&rsquo;s Shame&rdquo;; but doubtless looks a great
deal more impressive in its unfinished state, in the semblance of
a ruin, than it would were it ever finished.&nbsp; A variety of
other freak buildings keep it company: the Nelson Monument,
memorials to Burns, to Dugald Stewart, and to Professor Playfair,
together with what the many &ldquo;guides,&rdquo; who by some
phenomenal instinct scent the stranger from afar, call an
&ldquo;obsairvatory.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Coaching days at Edinburgh ceased in 1846, when that sole
surviving relic of the coaches between London and the
North&mdash;the Edinburgh and Berwick coach&mdash;was
discontinued on the opening of the Edinburgh and Berwick Company,
completing the series of lines that connect the two
capitals.&nbsp; It is true that passengers could not yet travel
through without changing, for the great bridges that cross the
Tyne at Newcastle and the Tweed at Berwick were not opened until
four years later; but it was possible, with these exceptions, to
journey the whole distance by train.&nbsp; The opening of the
railway meant as great a change for Edinburgh as did the
beginning of the New Town seventy years before.&nbsp; Just what
it was like then we may judge from the drawing made from the
Castle by David Roberts in 1847.&nbsp; The point of view he has
chosen is that from the Mons Meg Battery, and the direction of
his glance, omitting the Old Town on the right, is to the
northeast.&nbsp; Changes in detail have come about since then,
but, as a whole, it is the Edinburgh we all know: the Calton
Hill, with its cluster of weird monuments, prominent; the New
Town, stretching away vaguely to the water-side; while in the
distance, on the right, is seen the shore curving to Portobello;
the twin masses of the Bass Rock and North Berwick Law on the
horizon.&nbsp; Down in the New Town itself the changes are
evident.&nbsp; Where the toy train with its old-fashioned
locomotive is crawling out of the tunnel under the Mound, and
where the old Waverley Station is seen, alterations have been
plenty.&nbsp; The old North Bridge pictured here has given place
to a new, spanning the <a name="page255"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 255</span>ravine in three spans of
steel.&nbsp; Beyond it are still seen the smoked-grimed modern
Gothic battlements of the Calton Gaol, but the huge new hotel of
the North British Railway has replaced the buildings that rose on
that side of the old bridge, while the towering offices of the
<i>Scotsman</i> occupy the other, all in that florid French
Renaissance that is the keynote of modern Edinburgh&rsquo;s
architectural style.&nbsp; The Scott Monument stands where it
did, not, as David Roberts&rsquo;s drawing shows us, among
grounds but little cared for, but amid gay parterres and velvet
lawns.&nbsp; The Bank of Scotland has been rebuilt and all the
vacant sites long built upon; evidences these of half a
century&rsquo;s progress, the direct outcome of those railways
that two generations ago wrote &ldquo;Finis&rdquo; to the last
chapter in the romantic story of the Great North Road.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
